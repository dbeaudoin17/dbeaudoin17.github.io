         <h1>Note From the Editors</h1>
         
         <p>Following the idea of Anthony
            Engebretson&#x2013;Danielle Beaudoin, Tanima Shrivastava, and &#x141;ukasz Niparko
            teamed up to transcribe, code, and digitalize Walter Wilson&#x2019;s 1913 book
            <cite>&#x201c;Hell in Nebraska: A Tale of the Nebraska Penitentiary.&#x201d;</cite>
            They embarked on this journey to Nebraska State Penitentiary as part of
            their Digital Humanities course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
            (UNL)&#x2014;Digital Archives and Editions with Prof. Amanda Gailey (ENGL
            478/878).</p>
         
         <p>Anthony Engebretson is a graduate student and employee at UNL, he will begin
            pursuing a Master&#x2019;s degree with the History department in the fall. For the
            <cite>&#x201c;Hell in Nebraska&#x201d;</cite> project, Anthony transcribed and coded
            Chapters 1-10 and the prelude. <em>"When looking for texts that would
               be interesting for a project, I wanted to find something that would
               give insight on the history of incarceration. It felt very relevant
               with discussions of prison and police reform (or the abolition of
               these institutions entirely) gaining so much prominence. I focused
               my purview on incarceration in Nebraska. It wasn&#x2019;t long before I
               came across a bizarre little book called &#x2018;Hell in Nebraska&#x2019;.
               Wilson&#x2019;s intent with writing this book was to destigmatize prison.
               In many ways, he portrayed a relatively nuanced and sympathetic view
               of prisoners, but at the same time he clearly had many prejudices
               and biases, and his interaction with the system was anything but
               challenging. But he inadvertently provided us an interesting look at
               the state of Nebraska&#x2019;s carceral system in the early 20th
               century."</em></p>
         
         <p>Danielle Beaudoin is a UNL undergraduate student in the Department of
            Anthropology, with a focus in cultural anthropology, and with plans to do a
            service year with AmeriCorps, and then pursue a Masters in Library Sciences
            with a focus on archival work. For the <cite>&#x201c;Hell in Nebraska&#x201d;</cite>
            project, Danielle was responsible for transcription and coding Chapters
            11-21, the conclusion, the front and back matter, along with the note from
            the editors. <em>I have an interest in bridging the gaps in the system
               which disproportionately affect BIPOC across all avenues such as
               health care, education, incarceration, among others. This project is
               incredibly important when considering all the work that needs to be
               done in leveling the inequity of these institutions in our culture.
               &#x201c;Hell in Nebraska&#x201d; is a look into how the prison system and the
               legal system historically functioned. Many of the biases and
               prejudices expressed in this work are still in effect today, and
               still influence the systemic racism in this country. It&#x2019;s important
               to recognize that not much has changed in that
               regard.</em></p>
         
         <p>Tanima Shrivastava is a UNL undergrad with the College of Arts and Science
            with Computer Science and English majors and a minor in Mathematics. For the
            <cite>&#x201c;Hell in Nebraska&#x201d;</cite> project, she was responsible for
            dividing the transcription tasks for the group, transcribing and coding for
            Chapters 32-40, documenting steps for standardizing standoff elements,
            writing CSS and personal bio and creating XSLT elements such as figure,
            figDesc, note, list, references of persons and places and their child
            elements such as occupation, region, name, note etc. <em>I have
               interest interdisciplinary studies, as a consequence of which my
               concentration of English major is in Digital Humanities. I am
               currently a web developer and Research Assistant for The George
               Eliot Archive, which is a digital humanities research at UNL. This
               project is exciting to work with, as it not only presented a
               technical design challenge, it also creates awareness about the
               state of prisoners in Nebraska. It is surprising how despite
               documents such as these, reforms have still not been implemented in
               such institutions to better the recreation of the outcasts of the
               society. </em></p>
         
         <p>&#x141;ukasz Niparko is a UNL graduate student in the Department of Political
            Science, specializing in civil society and human rights. For the
            <cite>&#x201c;Hell in Nebraska&#x201d;</cite> project, &#x141;ukasz was responsible for
            transcription and coding Chapters 22-32. <em>"While doing so, I was
               thinking of the past and present of American and European
               penitentiary systems; just as now also back then, restorative
               justice was only something to dream about, and to some extent, the
               prison experience in Wilson&#x2019;s time seemed to be more organic&#x2014;at
               least less free from corporate ties and the ultimate
               school-to-prison pipeline, though unfree from discrimination and
               various human rights violations that Wilson unwillingly describes
               while trying to present Nebraska State Penitentiary in quite
               &#x2018;bright' hues"</em></p>

         <h1>PREFACE</h1>
         
         <h1>THE TIGER IN HIS DEN</h1>
         
         
         <p> Two ladies came into my office one afternoon and asked if they could go through
            the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison.</a>
            <q>"And do you think it would be perfectly safe for us to go through?"</q>
            said one. I told them that nobody would harm them. <q>"Why, of course, it is
               safe to go in there,"</q> said the other, <q>"I told you so all the
               time. The prisoners are locked up in steel cages and those who are out in
               the yard are wearing ball and chains, and if one should start after us, we
               could tell him a mile off by his striped clothes."</q> I took the ladies
            inside the prison. From the chapel they went to the library. The librarian, a
            young man, told them how many volumes were in the library; from there we went to
            this greenhouse where the florist gave each a carnation, and from there through
            the yard into the cell building. There were no prisoners in the cells, for they
            were working in the factories. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>"Well, when do we get to see the prisoners?"</q> asked the ladies.
            <q>"Madam,"</q> I said, <q>"the librarian and the man who gave you
               the flowers and all the men here in the yard, are prisoners."</q> The
            ladies looked surprised, and said, <q>"Why none of them wear chains, they
               don't even wear stripes. This is so different from what we expected to
               see."</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>Throughout the great <a href="#nebraska">state</a> are hundreds of people,
            who like these two ladies, have entirely wrong ideas of this much advertised
            <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison.</a>, of its managers and of
            its inmates. They think that the former are brutes and slave drivers, and the
            latter desperate criminals, always kept penned up in cages like the tigers in a
            menagerie. To fully explain, to set the public right, and to correct the many
            wrong conceptions about the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Nebraska State
               Penitentiary</a>, its managers and its inmates is, far more than financial
            gain, the object of this little book; and if you, dear reader, will now follow
            me through the big <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, I will show
            you, no ferocious animals, but men, mere men, who have made a little mistake in
            life, and who are taking their medicine like men. I will show you some prison
            officials, who are men also, men with red blood in their veins, men with hearts
            full of sympathy for their fallen brothers; and I will show you the cleanest,
            most sanitary and best managed prison in the <a href="#unitedstates">country</a>. Just follow me, there will be neither lions nor tigers to
            injure you. </p>
         <br>Yours truly,</br>

         <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>
         
         <h1>THE KINGDOM OF LANCASTER</h1>
         
         
         <p>Visitors to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> take the car
            marked "Penitentiary" leaving <a href="#tenthando">Tenth and O
               Streets</a> every forty minutes. The <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a> is located in a suburb called <a href="#lincoln">Lancaster</a>, or rather, <a href="#lincoln">Lancaster</a> is
            located at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>, for
            outside of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> there is but
            little else at <a href="#lincoln">Lancaster</a>. There is a railroad with
            a signpost but without a depot; there is a post office with a few stamps, but
            without a postmaster and there is a little store with root beer, none of that
            which made made <a href="#milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> famous. </p>
         
         <p>
            <a href="#lincoln">Lancaster</a> is a little independent kingdom, for its
            inhabitants upon entering are not subject to the laws of <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, but to the rules and regulations set down by the warden,
            the uncrowned king, who is a far more independent ruler than any monarch of
            Europe, he being not only king, but senate and house of representatives all in
            one; his word is law, and his will supreme. The present ruler, <a href="#fenton">William T. Fenton</a>, of the Dynasty of <a href="#richardson">Richardson</a> county, ascended the throne on January
            the eighteenth, 1913, and the inhabitants immediately swore allegiance to him.
            The Crown Prince is the heir apparent and the regent in the absence of the king;
            he is also called the Deputy Warden, and his name is <a href="#harmon">N. T.
               Harmon</a>. </p>
         
         <p>A cabinet of six high moguls assist in the government and they are: Secretary of
            State and foreign affairs, Mr. <a href="#oconnell">James O'Connell</a>,
            (Chief Clerk); Secretary of Commerce, <a href="#kirby">W. A. Kirby</a>,
            (Steward); Secretary of War, <a href="#kavanaugh">Dan Kavanaugh</a>,
            (Assistant Deputy Warden); Secretary of the Interior, <a href="#cokely">Tom
               Cokely</a>, (Yardmaster); and Secretary of Agriculture, <a href="#buchholz">Gus Buchholz</a>. The office of Secretary of the Navy
            was discontinued by orders from the throne, the present regime being much
            opposed to ships, especially schooners that pass late in the night and carry
            forbidden cargoes. </p>
         
         <p>There is also a matron who has charge of all the female inhabitants in the
            kingdom. At the present writing there are seven, all of dusky hue, and all
            suffragettes. There is a chief engineer, Mr. <a href="#mccarthy">McCarthy</a>, who makes the big wheels go around, and makes the lights
            shine over the land. He is a man of ability, a high grade mechanic and almost
            indispensable to the state. There is a chaplain, who, with the exception of two
            hours on the Sabbath morning, when he pilots the sinners toward the pearly gate,
            is kept busy drawing and expending his enormous salary. Then there are two
            turnkeys, who have the keys in their custody and are the connecting links
            between the outside and the inside, or rather, as a sanctimonious old lady
            mission worker told me once, <q>"they stand between good and evil."</q>
            There was vitriol in the stare she gave me when I answered: <q>"You are
               right, Madam, there are so many evil people wandering around here craning
               their necks to get to look at the good people on the inside."</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>There is a standing army of thirty-five men called guards by outsiders, and
            <q>"screws"</q> by the inmates. Where or how the latter name
            originated I do not know, but it is used in all prisons. The army has its
            headquarters in a large dormitory over the chapel where it sleeps on its arms,
            ready for service in case there should be a revolution in the kingdom. Assistant
            Deputy Warden <a href="#kavanaugh">Kavanaugh</a> is the major general of
            this army and Doctor <a href="williams">G. E. Williams</a> is the surgeon
            general. Several famous sharpshooters serve in this army, such as Colonel <a href="#jenkins">Jack Jenkins</a>, Colonel <a href="#morse">Frank
               Morse</a>, and Mr. <a href="#evans">Henry Evans</a>. I should not
            like to be the target for any of these three gentlemen, for when they shoot they
            never miss their mark. Mr. <a href="#evans">Evans</a> has been connected
            with the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> for several years, and
            under several wardens. He has also served with <a href="#genlawton">General
               Lawton</a> in the <a href="#phillipines">Philippines</a> where he
            established a reputation as a daring soldier and a crack shot. He also displayed
            great bravery on the day of the outbreak, of which I shall tell you later. Mr.
            <a href="#pendarvis">B. Pendarvis</a> has also seen service under
            several administrations and has proven himself to be a successful prison man.
            Mr. <a href="#chasberry">Chas. Berry</a> is the oldest on the prison roll,
            having served for over twenty years; he is in charge of factory "C." He is a
            gentleman, and the right kind of a man for a public institution. </p>
         
         <p>The safety of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> at night is in
            the hands of Mr. <a href="#boyd">J. Boyd</a>, for many years police
            officer, and formerly special police of the worlds fair at <a href="#philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Mr. <a href="#boyd">Boyd</a> is well acquainted with many crooks of international reputation. </p>
         
         <p> It is much to be regretted that the prison is compelled to furnish electric
            light for several other public institutions, for while these are lighted in
            splendid grandeur at all times of the night, the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> itself is short of lights at
            night, while it really should be well supplied with lights, that anyone
            approaching the prison could be seen. For what few lights there are now, credit
            is due to former Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, who upon taking
            office saw at a glance the importance of lights in front of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. </p>
         
         <p>On the following page I present to my reader a photo of many members of the new
            administration: Reading from left to right they are as follows: Mr. <a href="#cavanaro">A. Cavanaro</a>, a splendid, clean-cut, young officer
            who knows well how to handle men and is well liked by the inmates. The second
            gentleman is <a href="#kopf">David Kopf</a>, manager of the guard's dining
            room. Third is <a href="#spelts">Louis Spelts</a>, deputy steward. Fourth
            is <a href="#chasberry">Charles Berry</a>; and next to him is Colonel <a href="#morse">Frank Morse</a>, who has seen service also at the <a href="#iowapenitentiary"><a href="#iowa">Iowa</a>
               Penitentiary</a>. Mr. <a href="#werner">Albert Werner</a> is the sixth;
            he is the deputy farm superintendent, and expert on raising beans. If it had not
            been for the drouth he would have had a splendid crop of beans. Reading from
            left to right, second row, sitting down, are: first, <a href="#fenton">William J. Fenton</a>, turnkey; second, Mr. <a href="#buchholz">Gus
               Buchholz</a>, farm superintendent. 
            <div>

               <p>Prison Staff</p>
               <small>"Warden Fenton And His Men."</small>
               </div> My friend <a href="#buchholz">Gus</a> is a thorough farm manager
            and had it not been for his skill there would not have been much of a corn crop
            this year. Third is Mr. <a href="#hepfinger">William Hepfinger</a>, a
            mighty good fellow and an inventor of several labor saving devices. Fourth is
            <a href="#miller">Bryan Miller</a>, formerly scout in the <a href="#phillipines">Philippines</a>; for several nights he scouted
            around Subig Bay at the risk of losing his life to locate the insurrectos. Fifth
            is <a href="#knopfke">Frank Knopfke</a>, also a former soldier. Third row
            from left to right standing: Mr. <a href="#griffin">J. M. Griffin</a>,
            keeper of Factory "B," the largest shop within the walls, employing over one
            hundred men; second is Mr. <a href="#mcwilliams">F. McWilliams</a>, the
            man in the uniform; third is Mr. <a href="#mcneil">James McNeil</a>,
            keeper of Factory "A"; fourth is <a href="#schroeder">Walter
               Schroeder</a>, the traveling detective of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>; fifth is Mr. <a href="#ejohnson">L. E. Johnson</a>, dining room superintendent. Mr. <a href="#ejohnson">Johnson</a> has done much hard work to have the
            inmates' meals properly prepared and served. He has also added many new dishes
            to the bill of fare. He believes that "Cleanliness is next to Godliness,"
            and keeps the big dining room as clean as a pin. Next to him is Mr. <a href="#cook">Cook</a>, keeper of factory "F," where the fancy little
            whisk brooms are made; last in the row stands Mr. <a href="#oconnell">James
               O'Connell</a>, chief accountant of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Fourth row standing up against the wall are Chaplain <a href="#chaplainjohnson">P. C. Johnson</a> of <a href="#vonwerner">von Werner</a> escape fame; second, Warden <a href="#fenton">Wm. T.
               Fenton</a>, and next to him, stands his able deputy, Doctor <a href="#harmon">N. T. Harmon</a>; fourth, the tallest man. in <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, is <a href="#stephens">C. L. Stephens</a>, who is so tall that he can look into the second tier
            of cells in the cell building from the ground floor; next to him is Mr. <a href="#herndon">Herndon</a>, also a <a href="#phillipines">Philippine</a> soldier, a brave young man and a fine fellow; and next
            comes Mr. <a href="#sullivan">Patrick Sullivan</a>, deputy yardmaster of
            the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>. </p>
         
         <p>Why the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> was built in a hole in
            the ground instead of on the hillside to the south is more than I can explain.
            So low is the present location that in times of flood the basement has been
            filled with water and the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> was
            inaccessible except in boats. </p>
         
         <p> The administration building is a three and one-half story structure from which
            extend two large buildings, called the east and west cell buildings
            respectively, both of which face the public road. From his prison cell the
            lonely convict sees the merry crowd pass to and from the little park a mile west
            of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> called the
            <q>"Beer Garden"</q>; girls and boys leaving the beer garden
            in the early morning hours are usually feeling happy and serenade the convict in
            his cell as they pass by, and he in return lets out a yell that can be heard a
            mile away. Learned linguists differ somewhat on the meaning of this yell.
            <i>some (sic) </i> translate it into: <q>"Never mind, some day I will be
               there too,"</q> while others say that it means: <q>"Oh, if I only had
               a girl like you."</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> A tall wall extends from the cell building to the south. It is a gray and gloomy
            old wall and serves to keep those in who would like to get out, and to prevent
            anyone from breaking into the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penintentiary</a>. Several snakes make their home here in the old wall,
            while on top of it are six towers, in each of which sits a guard with a loaded
            rifle. There is a big gate in the east wall, and in the tower above it sits a
            crackshot of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, Colonel <a href="#jenkins">Jack Jenkins</a>, with his hand on his rifle, ever ready
            for business. At the gate stands another official Mr. <a href="#morse">Frank
               Morse</a>, who carefully inspects each incoming and outgoing wagon and
            searches all the <q>"Trusties"</q> who pass through the gate. Due
            to his vigilance no one attempts to smuggle contraband, such as guns or
            <q>"dope,"</q> into the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> by this route. </p>
         
         <p>To the north of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> is a garden,
            where trusty prisoners raise large quantities of vegetables for the inmates'
            kitchen. There is also an orchard, but it is like the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, located on too low ground and
            is a failure so far as fruit is concerned, for it produces only sufficient fruit
            in a season to make a dozen pies, but it is a success as a screen for escaping
            inmates. To the west and south are located the two hundred acres of farm land
            belonging to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. There is a
            small lake south of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> wall
            and about three acres of land which is not used except to give room for some old
            sheds. I have called the attention of several senators to this piece of land and
            to extending the south wall to take in this piece of land and the lake. There
            are some large trees and shrubbery on it, and it would make a splendid
            recreation park for the boys; and by moving the green house to the shore of the
            lake a most beautiful landscape could be effected. Unfortunately there was never
            enough cash on hand with which to carry this through, but I hope there will be
            some day; and I believe that the state would save in a few years, on drugs and
            castor oil, far more than the cost of construction. </p>
         
         <p>Having seen all there is to see on the outside of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, let us now see the inside. </p>
         
         <p>To the right as you enter, is the reception room. A card on the door reads
            "Come without knocking; go out the same way." This card is a relic of
            the Honorable <a href="#robb">Mont Robb</a>, a former official, who did
            not believe in knockers, especially those who knocked the Honorable <a href="#robb">Mont Robb</a>. In this room is where the visitors wait for
            the ushers to come and take them through the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. For years it was customary to pay ten cents to go through and
            see the entire <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> upon taking office, discontinued the charging
            of the admission fee, saying in his report to the governor, that he deemed it
            unjust to charge the taxpayers a fee to see an institution that they themselves
            maintained. The going through was entirely discontinued by Warden <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>, who did this as a matter of precaution in
            order to keep out the <q>"dope."</q> So there is no more
            sightseeing at the big <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> except
            in case you have a friend serving time there, in which event you may come and
            visit him on the second Thursday of each month. You may talk to your friend
            through the screen, but there is no hand shaking, no lovemaking, no kissing; and
            a guard walks up and down and hears what you talk about. Those who visit must
            come perfectly sober, for even the smallest fragrance of the stuff that made
            <a href="#kentucky">Kentucky</a> famous upon their breath means that
            they do not go in; and you must not carry any bottles in your hip pocket, for
            there is a new law passed, making it a felony to bring opium or whiskey into the
            pen&#x2014;so be careful. </p>
         
         <p>Opposite the reception room is the warden's office and that of the chief clerk.
            On the other side of the hall is the old abandoned postoffice, now used for the
            steward's headquarters. One stairway leads down into the basement where are the
            warden's kitchens and warerooms, and, another leads upstairs to the warden's
            apartments on the second floor, and to the deputy warden's apartments on the
            third floor. Here is also the female department. </p>
         
         <p>I have always thought that it was a shame to send a woman to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>. There has been one
            hundred and four female inmates in this <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> since its establishment in 1869, of which fifty-eight were
            negroes, one an Indian, and forty-five white women. The rooms in the women's
            department are large and airy and resemble more the rooms in a hotel than prison
            quarters. Two women occupy one room, and all they have to do is to keep their
            quarters clean. I wish that all the girls working in shops and stores could have
            as comfortable rooms as these prison girls at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. There are at present six
            colored women and one white woman. Of the one hundred and four women, sixty were
            sent here for larceny, two for horse stealing, one for aiding in rape, and two,
            (strange, but nevertheless true) for rape, sixteen for murder, and the remainder
            for assaults of various kinds. On the outside, their occupations were:
            fifty-five domestics, thirteen demimondes, one teacher, one snake charmer; and
            the others had no occupation. The women seem to get along nicely, they attend
            services every Sunday and generally do as they please. I think it would be much
            better for the women if they had some work to occupy their minds while in
            prison, but there does. not seem to be anything suitable for them to do. </p>
         
         <p> At the base of the hall is a big steel door behind which is the turnkey's room.
            When once you enter here you are under lock and key. In this room is a large
            safe, containing the keys of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. The chief turnkey, Mr. <a href="#shurtleff">Shurtleff</a>, is the custodian and is responsible for them. So expert
            has this gentleman become in handling the prison keys that he can tell
            blindfolded where any key belongs. He will ask the ladies to leave their
            handbags in his care while they visit the inside, which is a precautionary
            measure taken to keep out the <q>"dope."</q> From here we enter
            the chapel where services are held on Sunday morning. All the inmates, both male
            and female attend this service, and notwithstanding that there are forty
            churches in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, a large crowd of women from
            <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> come out to the prison church also.
            Whether these young women come to worship their Lord, or to gaze at the
            prisoners, I will leave for my reader to guess, or rather come to church some
            Sunday and see for yourself. If you come to church, be sure and be at the prison
            entrance at fifteen minutes to ten o'clock, for at that time the big steel doors
            close and they do not swing open for anyone while the inmates are at church. The
            services last an hour, and you will hear some good singing by the prison choir
            and beautiful music by the prison band and orchestra. </p>
         
         <p>After the service there is Sunday-school for an hour and at twelve o'clock the
            inmates march to their dinner and the doors open for you to go home. In one
            corner of the chapel is the deputy warden's office with the rogues' gallery.
            Opposite is the library containing nearly four thousand volumes, mostly fiction,
            and under supervision of a life time inmate. A large steel door leads from the
            chapel into the west cell house, which is large and spacious. Here sleep those
            men who work in the contract shops. There are cells to accommodate over, four
            hundred. Following the outbreak Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> set
            about to find an experienced prison man to take charge of this building. He went
            looking for a man who would treat the prisoners with. kindness arid yet be firm
            enough to keep the place quiet, in good order and also in good sanitary
            condition; such a man he found at <a href="#ftmadison">Fort Madison, <a href="#iowa">Iowa.</a></a>, penitentiary, in the person of Mr.
            <a href="#hesse">John L. Hesse</a>, an experienced prison man, who has
            kept the big building in first class condition ever since. There is also another
            and smaller cell building in which sleep all the trusties and those prisoners
            not working on contract labor. This room also serves as practice room for the
            band and orchestra. From there we pass into the guards' dining room and
            kitchens. There is not much to see in this department, for it looks more like an
            old barn than a place for state officials to eat, however, it is going to be
            remodeled. Passing out into the yard, we see another building under
            construction, the first floor of which will serve as the inmates' dining room
            and kitchen, and I doubt if there is a better or more modern dining room in any
            prison in the country than this will be when completed. The second story will be
            used for a hospital, and will be as modern as any hospital anywhere. The floors
            throughout are to be of white marble; there will be a perfectly equipped
            operating room, twelve large rooms for the sick boys, a place for the insane and
            a separate ward for consumptives. There will also be a dark room, a special diet
            kitchen, a dispensary and a private consultation room. </p>
         
         <p> This building is being erected by superintendent of construction, Mr. <a href="#hester">W. B. Hester</a>, who with the exception of two
            mechanics, uses inmate labor only. To the east of the new building is the
            greenhouse, located in the center of a beautiful little park. In the greenhouse
            can be seen two of the curiosities of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, an ever blooming Lantana Vine, sixteen years old, which has
            become as large as a tree, and perhaps the largest goldfish in the <a href="#nebraska">state</a>, <q>"Old Bill."</q> The boys
            say that he is serving a life sentence for he has been there longer than any
            other inmate, and seems to be perfectly satisfied. The greenhouse is managed by
            a life term prisoner, who loves his work and raises many beautiful oleanders,
            palms, and hybiscus, cacti, and many other rare plants and flowers. </p>
         
         <p>From the greenhouse we pass to the workshops. There is a chair factory turning
            out some of the most beautiful reed and rattan chairs, some retailing as high as
            forty dollars: Then there is a broom factory and a whiskbroom factory. These
            three factories employ about two hundred men. There is a modern laundry, and a
            cold storage plant, and the engine rooms and the
            <q>"hanghouse,"</q> which is now being torn down as there will
            be no more hangings in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>. You have now seen
            the inside of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> from start to
            finish, as the average visitor sees it. In the following chapter I will show it
            to you as the incoming prisoner sees it. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER TWO</h1>
         
         <h1>GETTING INTO THE PENITENTIARY</h1>
         
         
         <p>The telephone in my office rang one night and a lady at the other end of the wire
            said: <q>"Hello, has little <a href="#willie">Willie</a> got there
               yet?"</q>
            <q>"Which <a href="#willie">Willie</a>, Madam?"</q> was my answer,
            <q>"we have so many Willies here."</q>
            <q>"Who is this anyway? I thought it was Mrs. Jones."</q>
            <q>"No Madam, this is the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>, and we will take good care of <a href="#willie">Willie</a> when he comes."</q>
            <q>"No, for heavens sake, no; don't believe that my <a href="#willie">Willie</a> will ever come to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>."</q> Maybe <a href="#willie">Willie</a>
            will, and maybe <a href="#willie">Willie</a> won't; and let us hope that
            <a href="#willie">Willie</a> don't; but man not being master of his
            own destiny can never tell what may happen to him. There are three hundred and
            sixty men in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> now and there
            is capacity for a hundred more; but if all those who by rights should be in
            prison, but did not get caught, were to go there, it would be necessary to
            enlarge it many times. The three hundred and sixty happened to get caught, and
            that is why they are there. There has been behind these gloomy walls some of the
            brightest men in the <a href="#unitedstates">country</a>, bankers,
            lawyers, state officials, judges, doctors, merchants, and others. If you had
            told any one of these men that he was to land in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a> some day, he would not
            believe it. I shall mention one particular case, a man who had been a banker for
            years, and a mine owner in a western state, and for a while everything seemed to
            come his way. He lived in regal style at one of the finest hotels and moved in
            the best of society. </p>
         
         <p>One evening he called the head waiter to his table and scolded him for putting
            carnations on his table instead of roses. <q>"You know well, that I do not
               enjoy my meals except with plenty of roses on my table."</q> The head
            waiter bowed deeply and apologized, for the mine owner was a liberal patron. He
            would see that this awful mistake should not happen again.</p>
         
         <p>The mine owner was a heavy plunger and speculator and when the panic came along
            it wiped him off the financial map. Within a month he became penniless, gave a
            check where there were not sufficient funds to meet it&#x2014;results: a year and
            some months in <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. He was
            assigned to work in the inmates' dining room to scrub the floors, and had to
            walk in water when he scrubbed. As he sat in the corner by his lonesome eating
            his dinner, he saw no roses, no cut glass, no waiters in full dress suits, no
            fashionable ladies and no soft music. No, he sat on a wooden bench, and ate his
            pork and beans out of a rusty tin plate. A large roach and several small ones
            devoured what crumbs of the coarse corn bread fell upon the floor. How the
            mighty have fallen! How things have changed! To this man, his trip became a
            lesson and changed him entirely. Never again for him! </p>
         
         <p>If you had told this man a year previous to his coming here that he was to land
            in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>, he would have
            told you that you were to land in an insane asylum; but it is easy to get into
            <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, and hard to get out; so
            if you, dear reader, should happen to overdraw your bank account, or if you
            should carry a gun, concealed in your pocket, or if you should happen to love a
            young girl slightly under eighteen, or something else, you too, might become a
            guest at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, providing that you
            got caught. Here is what would happen to you: His honor, the judge, would say to
            you: <q>"It is now adjudged by the court, that you, <a href="#willie">Willie</a> Jones, be imprisoned in the penitentiary located in or
               near the city of, <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>,<a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> for a period of not less than one, nor
               more than twenty years, at hard labor, Sundays and holidays excepted, none
               of this time to be spent in solitary confinement. The sheriff will, with all
               possible speed and within thirty days, take you hence and deliver you to the
               warden of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>."</q> This is what is called the indeterminate
            sentence. If you are good and attend to your own business you will be summoned
            before the pardon board when you have served ten months and given a hearing, and
            it is then determined when you are to go out. </p>
         
         <p>When the sheriff brings a new prisoner, he takes him into the warden's office,
            and turns over the commitment papers there. Some of the sheriffs will tell the
            warden what a good man he is bringing, and others will tell him what a bad man
            the prisoner is. There is one sheriff from the <a href="#sandhills">sand
               hills</a>, who usually tells that he is bringing a notorious desperado,
            that he had an awful time capturing him, but that he finally landed him. The
            warden sizes up the new man and takes him into the office of the chief clerk
            where he is booked and given a number. </p>
         
         <p>He then turns over the money he has for deposit in the prison bank, and his
            jewelry for the safety deposit vault, and his cigarette papers for the waste
            basket. From there he is taken to the office of the turnkey, and now he is
            behind the prison bars. Here is where many a prisoner breaks down and cries
            (when the turnkey opens the large steel door and bids him enter) for he realizes
            that he is now a convict and that he must remain here perhaps for a long time. I
            believe that in more than half the cases, were he pardoned right then and there,
            that he would never again trespass against the laws of the land. I have seen
            many a young fellow break down and cry bitterly, and often I have tried to
            comfort him, and tell him not to worry, that the place is not as bad as it is
            painted and that before long, perhaps he will gain his liberty. This makes them
            feel better; they know they have a friend at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> who sympathizes with them, and
            with a somewhat lighter heart the new prisoner proceeds to the Bertillon room,
            where the assistant deputy warden makes a record of every mark and scar upon his
            body and measures the length and width of his head, his height, length of his
            nose, of his left little finger, of his forearm, and of his left foot. His
            picture is taken, and all this is filed away in case he should escape later on.
            Then he puts on his prison uniform of gray and is now a full fledged convict. </p>
         
         <p>He is then taken before the deputy warden, who asks him to what church he
            belongs, what education he received, whether he uses tobacco, opium or liquors,
            how long he has lived in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> and what his
            occupation is. Also he states the name and <i>postoffice (sic) </i> address of his
            wife, children, father, mother, brothers and sisters, and all this is carefully
            recorded. He signs an authority for the warden to receive and open his mail, and
            he is asked to sign not only his name but his number as well. The number is,
            however, only used as a matter of record and he is always called by his name,
            and never by his number. It is explained to him that it pays to be good, and
            that the better he is the sooner he gets out. The incoming man usually assures
            the deputy that he is going to be good, for he wants to go home as soon as
            possible. Once in a while a prisoner acts contrary; and I once heard a new negro
            tell that he was a bad, bad man and that he could stand upon his head a few
            years if necessary. <q>"All right, my boy,"</q> said the deputy, <q>"we
               have had several here like you, they came in like roaring lions but went out
               like little lambs. Your case shall have my special attention, and you will
               be a good boy before you know it."</q> A German gentleman was received
            once, who asked the deputy if he could work at his trade. <q>"What is your
               trade?"</q> said the deputy warden. <q>"I am a glass blower,"</q>
            was the reply. There being but few bottles blown in <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, the deputy warden thought it
            better for him to make brooms for a few years, and thus have two trades, instead
            of one. </p>
         
         <p>A young <i>Roumanian (sic) </i>came in from <a href="#boxbuttec">Box Butte</a>
            county and asked if he could work as interpreter. He spoke all the mongrel
            languages of the Balkan lands, and Arabian besides, and would do his best to
            give satisfaction. <q>"Well, my boy, we speak but one language here, and
               mighty little of that,"</q> said the deputy. For two years the
            <i>Roumanian (sic) </i> shoveled coal. </p>
         
         <p>From the deputy warden's office, the new prisoner is taken to the cell keeper,
            who like another hotel clerk, assigns him to a room, but he does not ask his
            guest whether he will have a room with bath, nor if he wants to leave a call for
            in the morning. No, all guests here receive the same accommodations; a steel
            cell, about five feet wide, by seven feet long with two berths, of which the new
            man has to take the upper. There is a stationary wash stand and toilet in each
            cell. The cells are far too small for two men and it is torture indeed to be
            penned up in such a little compartment. Some inmate, poetically inclined, wrote
            the following tribute to his cell upon the wall, the day before he departed: </p>
         <q>
            
            "My prison cell was small and dingy,<br></br>
            With here a bug and there a jigger,<br></br>
            The architect must been quite stingy<br></br>
            Or surely he would planned it bigger.<br></br>
            Soon roam I free beneath the stars,<br></br>
            And with pure joy my heart does swell,<br></br>
            Because I hate them prison bars,<br></br>
            That kept me in that awful little cell."<br></br>
            
            </q>
         
         <p>And while there is little poetry in this, there is a lot of truth. To the
            incoming prisoner this narrow cell is a hell on earth, and very few of new men
            get any sleep at all the first night spent in one. At nine o'clock a bell rings
            which means to go to bed, then all lights in the cells go out. In the morning
            the bell rings at six o'clock. The prisoners dress and go to their breakfast,
            and from there back to their cells for a short rest. At seven the bell rings
            again for them to go to work. The new man is assigned to his particular place,
            and within a few days he becomes accustomed to the routine of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THREE</h1>
         
         <h1>LIFE AT THE PRISON</h1>
         
         
         <p>He who has to serve a time at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>
            may consider himself a part of one great, big machine. It is the same over and
            over everlastingly. You awaken when the big bell rings at six o'clock in the
            morning, you dress hurriedly. Soon another bell rings to notify you that
            breakfast is ready. You all fall in line and march to the dining room, where you
            will find but a small selection of delicacies on the bill of fare. It is hash,
            white bread and coffee for about three hundred and sixty-five mornings out of
            the year. </p>
         
         <p>The hash is made of fresh beef and potatoes, and is a substantial and nourishing
            food. When you have had breakfast you go to your cell and take a little rest or
            a smoke for ten or fifteen minutes; then another bell rings, which means line up
            and go to work. The men walk in line, single file, but do not use the lock step.
            As soon as they come into the shop they start to work immediately and keep it up
            until noon. The shops manufacture brooms, whiskbrooms, and reed and rattan
            chairs. You are supposed to work a certain amount called a task, and when your
            task is done, you may sit down or keep working. What your work over your task is
            credited to you and turned into the prison bank once a month. Of course there
            are some men who never make any overtime and prefer to sit down and rest. At
            noon the big whistle blows and the men march to the dining room. Here is served
            a good substantial dinner, although it is plain. For many years there was but
            little variety in the food or in the preparation of it. Upon taking office,
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> engaged for dining room
            superintendent, Mr. <a href="#walsh">Andrew Walsh</a>, who had served as
            chef for the officers in command of our army in the <a href="#phillipines">Philippines</a>. He at first gave the kitchens and dining room a general
            cleaning out, and put in many new utensils. Then he commenced to serve meals in
            true army style. How the boys did enjoy it! Formerly they used to know the
            regular bill of fare by memory, but now they never knew what was coming. The
            instruction from the warden was to feed good; have everything thoroughly
            prepared, have it clean and waste as little as possible. I have seen many a meal
            served in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> that would far
            surpass the meals served for a quarter in the restaurants; and I thought of the
            "bread line," in the large cities, and the poor in our own city, and wished that
            all the poor folks could fare as well as the boys at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. The Sunday dinner usually
            consisted of roast pork, brown gravy, mashed potatoes, and vegetables galore in
            season. Coffee and ice water goes with the dinner. Let us hope that the present
            warden will look alter the cows and install a silo and have some milk for the
            boys. The following is a list of dishes served in as much variety for dinner as
            possible: Roast fresh pork, roast beef, meat pie, beef with brown gravy, <a href="#newengland">New England</a> boiled dinner, stews, boiled and
            baked pork and beans, hamburger steak, beef roll, bean soup and vegetable soup,
            boiled, mashed and fried potatoes, parsnips, tomatoes, onions, turnips, cabbage,
            cauliflower and melons in season. These vegetables are raised in the prison
            garden, are served in abundance, and the men like them. However, there is no
            table cloth, no cut glass, no china or napkins, and no finger bowl. It may seem
            a little queer for the new corner at first but he soon gets used to it. The
            dishes are passed around by inmate waiters, who will not take a tip, for the
            reason that there is no money behind the wails. If you wish for another piece of
            bread, hold up your right hand, if water, hold up your cup, for there is no
            talking at the table. </p>
         
         <p>Dinner over with, the boys go to their cells for half an hour's rest. At one
            o'clock the big whistle again calls them to their work which lasts until five
            o'clock, then they again march in line to the dining room to supper. The supper
            consists of meat, vegetables, fruit, white bread and coffee or tea. The
            following is a list of dishes served for supper: stewed prunes, stewed apricots,
            peaches, apples or raisins, oatmeal, hominy, liver with gravy, fried bacon, meat
            stew, corn bread, wheat bread, butter, potato cakes, biscuits&#x2014;and the
            latter are usually as good as mother used to make. From the dining room after
            supper, the boys go to their cells and look for the mail man to come around. </p>
         
         <p>They are great readers indeed, and subscribe for many magazines and daily papers
            from all parts of the world. A special favorite among the dailies is the
            "<a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> Daily Star," which has a
            large list at all times. </p>
         
         <p>There are altogether nearly two hundred dailies and magazines received at the
            pen. There are also about one hundred. letters received every day. The papers
            and letters are distributed by the librarian, after first being read by the
            chief clerk. He also distributes books from the library and each man can have a
            book and read as much as he pleases. The boys feel very grateful towards
            Assistant Postmaster <a href="#ludlam">Ludlam</a> of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, who donates to the prison many returned and
            uncalled for periodicals. Also many people of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> send their magazines to <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> when they have read them. I have due respect for religious
            publications, but with the exception of two Christian Science magazines and a
            Catholic publication, there is but small demand for the religious magazines and
            papers. The magazines and great weeklies are read and re-read until they fall to
            pieces. Many of the boys like to read farm papers, for there are more farmers
            than any other calling in the pen; and many of the city boys take a liking to
            the farm papers - perhaps to be in as close touch with nature as circumstances
            will permit. The library is managed by an inmate. The present librarian is a
            young man serving a life sentence for a murder that he did not commit. He is an
            actor, a fine singer, and comes from a good Irish family, but happened to get
            mixed up with two tramps and now suffers the consequences. I sincerely hope that
            some kind-hearted governor will reduce his sentence, which would be no more than
            just. The two tramps are out long ago. He has put the library in as good
            condition as any city library on the outside, and takes a great interest in his
            work. </p>
         
         <p>The boys are glad to see the librarian come around, and they can now read until
            nine o'clock. If they do not feel like reading they can lie down and talk, smoke
            or rest. </p>
         
         <p>This is the way the boys spend their week days in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Those who have money in the
            prison bank may order what groceries or delicacies they wish twice a week. They
            are very fond of fruit and have some on hand nearly all the time. There is a
            cigar stand in connection with the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, where they can buy several brands of chewing and smoking
            tobacco and cigars; but they cannot buy any cigarettes, nor are they allowed to
            smoke them. Saturday is <q>"writing day,"</q> and the librarian
            passes around a sheet of paper to each man. The letters are read by the deputy
            warden and mailed every Monday morning. Saturday is also bath day, and the men
            march to the bath house to enjoy a shower bath. Sunday is a day of rest, the
            same as in any other place. There are services in the chapel and Sunday-school
            which last until noon. After dinner the Sunday edition of the "<a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> Daily Star" is distributed and the
            prisoners read the news and rest during the afternoon. Thus the time slips away
            in the prison faster than you imagine. </p>
         
         <p>The boys look forward to the two great holidays, the Fourth of July and Christmas
            day, not only for the elegant meal served on those days, and the liberty of the
            yard, but because each holiday is to them a milestone on their tedious journey.

         <h1>CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
         
         <h1>THE BOYS IN GRAY</h1>
         
         
         <p>By that I do not refer to the confederate soldiers, but to the boys at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. Several years ago Warden
            <a href="#beemer">Beemer</a> and his deputy, Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, decided to discontinue the use of
            striped suits and substitute them with dark gray ones like the uniforms worn by
            the mail carriers, only not quite such good cloth. There are at this writing
            about three hundred and sixty-five men at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, some serving from one year and up, and forty-eight serving
            for life. I told you in the preface that many visitors at the pen come there and
            expect to see a lot of desperadoes, but go away having seen only men&#x2014;mere
            men, men just like you and me, ordinary, everyday men. I divide these three
            hundred and sixty-five men into three classes, something like this: perhaps
            there are altogether twelve or fifteen desperate men, men who would kill you and
            think nothing of it, no more than you would think of killing a fly; such men as
            these enter the world as criminal and as such they will depart. Good Christian
            workers will only lose time trying to convert them for nothing in the world will
            ever convert them. Then there are thirty, maybe a little more or less, moral
            degenerates, such as have committed crimes against the other sex or against
            nature. Of these men I shall tell you more in one of the following chapters,
            headed "Prostitution in the Pen." The balance of the population, a little
            over three hundred, are the young men and those a little older, but who are
            first offenders. From the first two classes, come the repeaters, for their mind
            is set upon crime; and they leave the prison with their mind set to commit one
            or more crimes and sooner or later come back; if they do not come back to <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, it is because they went to
            some other pen, for they spend the biggest part of their lives behind the bars,
            and consider themselves in luck when they are not locked up. It is to the first
            offenders that I wish to call your particular attention. Do not think that
            because a man happens to make one wrong step and falls, that he is lost forever,
            but look upon these poor fellows with all the mercy you have in your heart.
            These men are not there because they are users of whiskey, as lots of the
            <q>"soulsavers"</q> will lead you to believe:<i>" (sic) </i> no,
            they are there because of circumstances, or because of bad luck more than
            anything else. And like a former employer of mine used to tell me, bad luck is
            bad management; and it is just bad management more than anything else that
            causes the young men to go to <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. What these young men needed before their trouble, more
            than anything else, was a good friend, one who could advise and counsel them and
            say to them: <q>"Don't do it."</q> One-half of these young men are
            orphans, and the other half are young men who drifted away from home. They had
            no one to guide them, or give them the few words of advice, that we all so much
            need at times in our life. If these men needed a friend before they blundered,
            they need him twofold when the big steel gate opens for them to enter the world
            again. Here, my dear reader, is a chance for you and many others to do some good
            in the world. I do not exactly mean to hand these men out a large roll of money.
            On the other hand, don't do it, but help them to get employment; treat them like
            men; do not remind them of their gloomy past but inspire hope within their
            hearts; make them feel that they are men among men again, and in ninety-five
            cases out of one hundred they will make good. There are men in the state, now
            making good, men who are model citizens, and a pride of the community, and it is
            extremely seldom that one of this kind comes back to prison. What <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> needs more than anything else, is what
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> suggested in his report to the
            governor&#x2014;it is his pet subject of prison reform for our state&#x2014;the
            segregation of the young then from the hardened criminals, if possible by
            building a reformatory, or if this is impossible, making certain changes at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> that would facilitate the
            complete separation of the two classes. He was very anxious to carry this out,
            and did more to promote segregation than any other warden ever did. I wish to
            stop here and inform my reader of late one night in December when the warden had
            finished dictating to me his report. </p>
         
         <p>I suggested to him that he permit me to send a carbon copy of the report to the
            governor elect at <a href="#fallscity">Falls City</a>. I said, <q>"I
               sincerely hope that the new governor will take interest in three of your
               recommendations, namely, the segregation of the boys, the severe laws
               against smuggling dope into the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> and the proper equipment of the outgoing inmate."</q>
            While Governor <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> never favored me with an
            acknowledgement of this copy, I was pleased to read of him incorporating all
            three of the warden's suggestions in his message to the legislature. Since then
            the legislature has passed a law making it a felony to smuggle
            <q>"dope"</q> into the prisons, and has appropriated money for
            the new reformatory; but I am very sorry that while they passed a law to equip
            the discharged convict properly when he leaves, and to pay him a part of the
            money that he earns in the pen, they forgot to appropriate the funds for this
            purpose, and the boys will continue for two years to go out in the world in the
            cheap suits that brand them everywhere as ex-convicts, and with only a
            five-dollar bill for a new start in life. </p>
         
         <p>To Senator <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a> of <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>,
            the boys are much obliged for the passing of these bills. The <a href="#dodge">senator</a> is a fine man, a leader among men, a man who
            did much good and one who took the interests of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> more to heart than any member of
            the senate. The boys in gray admire and love Senator <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a> for his good work and there are some who would fight for him,
            were it necessary. How different the business of our great state would be
            conducted if all communities elected senators and representatives who took an
            interest in their work like this <a href="#dodge">senator</a>. </p>
         
         <p>I went to the state house, and placed before each member of the legislature, the
            warden's report. I had a long talk with many of them, and all were more or less
            interested in the big prison. Most cordial of them all was Senator <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a>, and I was surprised to learn how much he knew
            of conditions at the pen. I was equally surprised at one of the representatives,
            or I should have said <q>"misrepresentatives,"</q> of <a href="#lancasterc">Lancaster County</a>, who, when I placed the report
            upon his desk, promptly threw it into the waste basket. He was evidently too
            busy to look at it, for he had his feet on his desk and was enjoying a cigar.
            Now I will leave it to the reader's judgment, which is the best&#x2014;to expend
            a reasonable amount on the boys discharged at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> and have them start out
            right, or to turn them out in the winter without even an overcoat and with only
            five dollars? Is it a wonder that some of these boys return? Had they been
            properly equipped, they would perhaps never have come in contact with the law
            again. </p>
         
         <p>To return to the boys, I must tell my reader why these men are at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, for every day I am asked,
            <q>"But what did all these men do to come here?"</q> The answer is:
            <q>"Some do one thing and some another."</q> During the last two
            years, there were received four hundred and fifty. Their crimes were as follows:
            burglary about one hundred and ten, larceny about fifty-five, larceny from
            person about one hundred and thirty, horse stealing thirty-five, rape about
            thirty, murder thirty-five, forgery fifty-five, safeblowing six, robbery
            twenty-five, wife desertion three, carrying concealed weapons one, playing poker
            three, chicken stealing one, cattle stealing nine, and the remainder assaults of
            various kinds. <q>"Well, where do all these men come from?"</q> is another
            question we answer every day. About one third came from <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>. During the past two years thirty-six came from <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>; </p>
         
         <p><a href="#richardsoncounty">Richardson</a> County comes third with twenty;
            and <a href="#hallc">Hall</a> and <a href="#cassc">Cass</a> Counties
            furnish nineteen each; <a href="#cheyennec">Cheyenne</a>, and <a href="#boxbuttec">Box Butte</a> sent a dozen each. The other counties
            average from four to six, except the virtuous counties of <a href="#blainecounty">Blaine</a> and <a href="#loganc">Logan</a>,
            who pride themselves on never sending a man to the pen. <a href="#loupcounty">Loup</a> County recently brought their first
            prisoner. The kindhearted sheriff found a good place for this boy to work when
            he was discharged. At this writing there are no prisoners from <a href="#loup">Loup</a>, and there are also eighteen other counties who
            are not represented. These are mostly the <i>sparcely (sic) </i> populated counties
            in the sand hill regions. Of these men, seventy-seven were born in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, sixty-two were foreigners from all parts
            of the globe, even from far away <a href="#arabia">Arabia</a>; from <a href="#japan">Japan</a> and the <a href="#phillipines">Philippine</a> Islands, from <a href="#haiti"><i>Hayti (sic) </i></a>,
            <a href="#romania"><i>Roumania (sic) </i></a>, <a href="#greece">Greece</a> and <a href="#australia">Australia</a>. <a href="#germany">Germany</a> furnished nine, <a href="#ireland">Ireland</a> five, <a href="#italy">Italy</a> four, <a href="#denmark">Denmark</a> four, and <a href="#canada">Canada</a>
            ten. Of American born, but not born in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>,
            there were forty-six from <a href="#missouri">Missouri</a>, forty-five
            from <a href="#iowa">Iowa</a>, thirty-six from <a href="#illinois">Illinois</a>, nineteen from <a href="#newyork">New York</a>, and
            the balance evenly from every state in the <a href="#unitedstates">Union</a>, with three from the little <a href="#districtofcolumbia">District of Columbia</a> . Of these two hundred and thirty-one pleaded
            guilty, one hundred and nineteen pleaded not guilty. The fact that they pleaded
            not guilty does not necessarily mean that they were innocent; nevertheless,
            there is many an innocent boy serving at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. They came here, in all ages and sizes; four were
            seventeen&#x2014;nothing but children. (I would like to examine the heart of the
            judge that sent these children to the pen. I think that he must have a heart of
            rock or ice.) Seventy-one were from eighteen to twenty. Just think of it, gentle
            reader! I know every one of these young men and I dare say that if the judge
            would have taken sixty-five of them and not sentenced them, but paroled them
            from the bench after having a heart to heart talk with them, none of them would
            ever have gone to prison. But the courts must grind out a certain number of men.
            There were one hundred and thirty from between twenty-one and twenty-five, just
            the age when a young man knows it all, or thinks that he does. There were about
            one hundred and fifty between twenty-five and thirty-five years old. About
            eighty-five were between thirty-six and sixty, three were sixty-three, and one
            was sixty-nine years old. Four hundred and eighteen had a common school
            education, eight were high school graduates, seven could read but not write, and
            seventeen were illiterate altogether. One hundred and twelve were married, nine
            divorced and three hundred and twenty-nine single. Two hundred and thirty-eight
            of the boys had lost their father, one hundred and eighty-nine had no mother;
            and is it strange that these boys should go astray? Twenty had no relatives of
            any kind. One hundred and forty-four were total abstainers, two hundred and
            ninety-nine were users of liquors, mostly moderate drinkers; and while I am not
            defending the saloons, I have learned from experience that circumstances and not
            whiskey, are what sends most men behind the bars. Six were constant users of
            <q>"dope."</q> All religions are represented at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, there being more Methodists
            than any other religion. There were about one hundred Methodists. There were
            less belonging to the Christian Science Church than any other, only one poor
            little boy, one of the seventeen-year old ones. There were only two Jews. One
            hundred and seventeen of the boys were not members of any church, but believed
            in God. One only was a non-believer; but as a bullet from the sheriff's gun has
            since blown him into other regions, he perhaps has changed his mind by this
            time. The new indeterminate sentence law has gone into effect, and half of the
            population have indeterminate sentences. It is up to them to be good and their
            sentence will be a short one. About one hundred and fifty have sentences from
            between one and three years. Eight have five years, seven have seven years, etc.
            Six have fifteen years, three have twenty years, two have twenty-two years, and
            there were fifteen received during the biennium with life sentences, making
            forty-eight life time prisoners altogether. One, the <a href="#prince">murderer</a> of our beloved <a href="#davis">deputy warden</a> is
            under a death sentence. </p>
         
         <p>As stated before there are men of all occupations at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>; and is it not strange that
            one-third of the boys are farmers? There are one hundred and six laborers and
            twenty-five cooks. The latter, might be wrong, for many of the prisoners state
            that they are cooks in order to get to work in the kitchen. There are sixteen
            barbers, nine bakers, six bookkeepers, eighteen painters, sixteen teamsters, one
            acrobat and one sailor, the latter doing but little sailing at this time. There
            is one doctor, one veterinary surgeon, and mechanics of all kinds. There are no
            bankers in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> now. And,
            speaking of bankers, there are less crimes committed against the banks in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> at the present time than ever before, for
            the bankers are well organized, and, like the old <a href="#safeblowjoe">safeblower</a> said to me, <q>"It is just impossible for an honest
               saleblower to work in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> since that man
               Johnson became chief of the bankers' secret service; and since they got the
               law passed to sentence us from twenty years to life for blowing a safe, it
               is another state for me."</q> Surely did <a href="#safeblowjoe">Joe</a> kept his word, for a week after he left <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> he was caught blowing a safe
            in <a href="#minnesota">Minnesota</a>, and being old and having served in
            seven pens in his day it looks as if he will spend the remainder of his life at
            <a href="#stillwater">Stillwater</a>. </p>
         
         <p>Of the four hundred and fifty received, three hundred and sixty were first
            offenders, while fifty-one were second timers and five were third timers. One
            came back for the fourth time. The latter is still a young man, not yet thirty.
            When I asked: <q>"Well <a href="#jim">Jim</a>, I looked for you back
               over a year ago, where have you been this long?"</q>

         <h1>CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
         
         <h1>SICK AND IN PRISON</h1>
         
         
         <p>When you are taken sick while in prison you remain in your cell in the morning
            after the other men have gone to their work. About nine o'clock the sick men
            fall in line and march to the dispensary where Doctor <a href="#williams">Williams</a> looks you over and in nine cases out of ten prescribes for
            you his favorite prescription, castor oil. You may have a broken leg, a pimple
            on your eye, or a corn on your foot, castor oil cures them all. When the <a href="#williams">doctor</a> first came to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, there was for several mornings
            a long line of sick men, but as the doctor administered to them the castor oil
            treatment the line grew smaller and smaller. The <a href="#williams">doctor</a> is also an expert in appendicitis cases and has a ready cure
            for all imaginary sickness. For instance an <a href="#oldjoe">old
               negro</a> came wobbling up to his office. He was so weak and delicate that
            he could hardly walk and he had to stop several times to take a rest. The <a href="#williams">doctor</a> examined the old fellow carefully and said:
            <q>"Well, <a href="#oldjoe">Joe</a>, what you need is an operation
               for appendicitis, you get ready for this, this afternoon."</q>
            <q>"Lawd, no, <a href="#williams">Doctor</a>, ah feels much improved
               right this minute."</q> The amount of potatoes that <a href="#oldjoe">Joe</a> has peeled since that day is something wonderful, and he walks
            around like a young man. No operation for <a href="#oldjoe">Joe</a>, well
            I guess not. At times it is hard to discriminate between those who are shamming
            and those who are really sick. The latter have indeed my sympathy, for their lot
            is a most unhappy one. The <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> has
            had a hospital consisting of one large room, which resembled a dormitory in some
            cheap lodging house more than a hospital, and in here were housed those with
            tubercular and private diseases, together with those temporarily sick, and these
            were in constant danger of infection. However, this hospital is a thing of the
            past, it having been torn down to make room for a new one to be as modern as man
            and money can make it. The new one will be ready this fall. </p>
         
         <p>In spite of the meager hospital facilities, there are nevertheless fewer deaths
            and less real sickness at the present time than in any other prison in the <a href="#unitedstates">country</a>. Looking in retrospect over the year of
            1912, there were only two deaths. In the month of July there were only eight
            hundred and sixty calls at the dispensary for medicine as against one thousand
            three hundred and twenty during July 1911. This splendid record must be credited
            to the never tiring efforts of <a href="#stradling">Doctor Stradling</a>
            and also to the good and well prepared food and the splendid music furnished by
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, as well as the clean and sanitary
            condition in which the cells and factories are kept. </p>
         
         <p>Acting upon the recommendation of <a href="#stradling">Doctor
               Stradling</a>, shower baths were installed and this serves much to promote
            better health and is far more pleasant than the old tub baths. There ought to
            be, and no doubt there will be before long, hot water installed in all the
            cells. But what is needed more than anything else and what will do more towards
            keeping the boys in good health, is a recreation park, which can be gotten by no
            other expense than extending the east and west walls and moving the south wall
            so to include the piece of land with the little lake to the south of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, which at the present serves no
            purpose except to give room for some old and ready-to-tumble-down shanties.</p>
         
         <p>Would it not be unpleasant to die behind the prison walls? And what becomes of
            the dead bodies? For years they have been buried in a little graveyard on the
            hillside to the south of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>.
            No marble monument marks the convict's grave, not even a painted board. The
            coffin, a common pine box, is carried to the grave by convicts, and lowered into
            the grave by them; then the grave is filled, and just a little mound indicates
            that a human being is buried there. However, if the prisoner has money or
            friends, the body is turned over to them. Recently a new law was passed, that of
            turning over to medical colleges the bodies of those convicts who have no money.
            A few years ago a man was under sentence to be hanged for murder. He had neither
            money nor friends, and while he did not appear to be worried over having to
            hang, he was always brooding over them turning his body over to a medical
            college. On the day of his execution, he turned to Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, at that time deputy warden, and with tears in his eyes,
            said, <q>"<a href="#delahunty">Jim</a>, there is one thing I wish to
               ask of you, I haven't a cent, but for mercy's sake, don't let the students
               get my body."</q> The kindhearted deputy took up a collection among the
            officers, made up the balance himself and the boy had a Christian funeral and
            rests in a cemetery in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER SIX</h1>
         
         <h1>THE DOPE HABIT</h1>
         
         
         <p>The most demoralizing, the most degrading of all prison features, is the
            <q>"dope"</q> habit, which causes endless grief and trouble,
            not only to the users themselves, but to the prison managers as well. It appears
            that the use of <q>"dope"</q> originated in <a href="#england">England</a> in the seventeenth century when times were hard and wages so
            low that the people could not afford to indulge in ale or whiskey, but had to
            find something cheaper, thus started the use of <q>"dope."</q> It
            was thought with wages rising that this <i>practise (sic) </i> would cease but it
            did not, on the contrary&#x2014; <q>
               <a href="#confessions">
                  "Those eat now, who never ate before,<br></br>
                  And those who always ate, now eat the more"<br></br>
                  </a>
               </q> and from <a href="#england">England</a> the habit spread all over
            the world, and once a slave of this deadly drug it is almost impossible to
            dispense with it. To get it, a user will lie, steal, even commit murder, and
            under the influence of it he will commit any crime on the calendar. Many
            prisoners are users of <q>"dope"</q> when they come to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, and try to smuggle a supply in
            with them in various ways, mostly in their shoes. I have seen the heels of a
            pair of shoes hollowed out and sufficient <q>"dope"</q> inserted
            to last a man for several years. Of course this is promptly destroyed. Some of
            the prisoners who never used it on the outside become users of it in prison.
            Perhaps they are put in the cell with one of these <q>"dope"</q>
            fiends who invites them to try it. They do, and like it. Soon they take another
            jolt and before they know it, they become <q>"dope"</q> fiends
            themselves. </p>
         
         <p>There is, however, some excuse for prisoners using this poison. Some of them,
            having been behind the bars for many years, completely shut off from all
            stimulants, after years of hard work, and all the time doing over and over again
            the same monotonous prison routine, find themselves some day mentally and
            physically weak and in need of some stimulant, and not being able to get any
            liquors, resort to <q>"dope."</q> Others may be sick, or have some
            grievance, imaginary or otherwise, and try to drown their troubles by using
            <q>"dope."</q> Looking at it in this light, there may be some
            excuse for it; and if you, my reader, were lying in a little steel cell in
            deadly pain or worried to death over the turn your affairs had taken, and sleep
            would not come to you, if one little piece of morphine about the size of a
            pin-head would put you to sleep, and give you sweet dreams besides, many of you
            would fall for it. Dreams of the sweetest kind come to the users of
            <q>"dope,"</q> pipe dreams as they are commonly called;
            perhaps you see the pearly gates and the garden of paradise and the house of
            many mansions. I recall the poet's description of such a pipe dream: </p>
         <q>
            <a href="#excursion">
               
               "The appearance instantaneously disclosed<br></br>
               Was of a mighty city&#x2014;boldly say<br></br>
               A wilderness of building, sinking far<br></br>
               And self withdrawn into a wondrous depth<br></br>
               
               Far sinking into splendor without end,<br></br>
               Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold<br></br>
               With alabaster domes and silver spires<br></br>
               And blazing terrace upon terrace, high<br></br>
               Uplifted, here serene <i>pavillions (sic) </i> bright<br></br>
               In avenues disposed, there towers begirt<br></br>
               With battlements that on their restless fronts<br></br>
               Bore stars&#x2014;illuminations of all gems."<br></br>
               
               </a>
            </q>
         
         <p>What an awful disappointment after dreaming such a dream, to awaken and find
            yourself behind the prison bars. And after the awakening comes those awful pains
            for which there is but one cure&#x2014;another jolt of
            <q>"dope."</q> Much attention has been paid to an article read
            by Judge <a href="#frost">Lincoln Frost</a> before the Social Service
            Club, dealing with the <q>"dope"</q> habit and other vices at the
            <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>. Before completing
            this chapter I called upon the <a href="#frost">judge</a>. I asked him if
            he had ever met Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, and he said that
            he did not even know him personally. I told him that I wished that he had called
            upon the <a href="#delahunty">warden</a> and gotten the information from
            him. There being always two sides to a story, it is well to hear both sides; and
            if Judge <a href="#frost">Frost</a> had gone in person to the prison and
            called upon the warden, I am certain that several errors that appear in his
            paper would not have appeared there. For a fact one of the inmates who furnished
            him with much information, especially against the inmate physician, Mr. <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a>, admitted to the <a href="#frost">judge</a> that he had himself sold <q>"dope"</q> at the
            pen. No matter what Mr. <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a> has done behind
            the prison bars, no matter what crime he committed to go there, give him his
            dues; and if those who abuse him could have seen what I saw, when the prison
            officials lay wounded&#x2014;how tenderly they were cared for by Mr. <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a>&#x2014;those people would themselves, if
            possessed of a heart at all, suggest that he be pardoned. While it is true that
            he is not a graduate physician, we must remember that the great state pays its
            doctor only seventy-five dollars and for that little amount he cannot spend all
            his time at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Rather than to
            let a man injured in the factory bleed to death, is it not better to have him
            attended to by one who understands how, even if he does not possess a diploma?
            The story of him administering poison to another inmate, is too absurd to
            comment upon. </p>
         
         <p>It is indeed surprising how the <q>"dope"</q> is smuggled into the
            prison. Some was concealed in the coal cars and a chalk mark made on the car.
            Once a negro woman left some English walnuts, which we opened and found fined
            with <q>"dope"</q> and carefully pasted together. Another time a
            woman brought several sacks of smoking tobacco, on which the revenue stamps had
            been carefully removed, <q>"dope"</q> inserted, and then carefully
            sealed again. Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> had this woman arrested
            and she served a sentence in the county jail. But to thoroughly and completely
            eradicate this evil, you must have the law with you, and at Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>'s suggestion, a law was enacted making it a
            felony for bringing <q>"dope"</q> and liquor into the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> and thus far no one has been
            willing to take such chances. What a pity that this law was not passed many
            years ago. </p>
         
         <p>On a cold winter night Judge <a href="#frost">Frost</a>, <a href="#roach">Rev. Roach</a>, <a href="#wilson">Bert Wilson</a>
            and a Mr. <a href="#mcbride">McBride</a> together with two ex-convicts
            bent upon revenge, went to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>
            on the ten o'clock car, went to the wooden gate, called a trusty and handed to
            him a bottle of morphine,&#x2014; enough to kill several men. It was indeed a
            nice affair for a former circuit judge to take part in. I am sorry that all of
            these gentlemen were not nabbed and jailed which they should have been, two of
            them committing a crime and the other four witnessing it. Was it a wonder that
            such a judge was retired to obscurity? <a href="#roach">Rev. Roach</a> has
            also been noted as a man attending more to other peoples' affairs than to his
            own. <a href="#wilson">Bert Wilson</a> is the man who furnished a
            traveling evangelist with much information that helped the city to go wet
            instead of going dry; and Mr. <a href="#mcbride">McBride</a>&#x2014;well,
            his lyceum fame and obtain- ing thousands of dollars is well known to the
            public. He succeeded in catching several prominent men fo sums ranging from
            fifty to two hundred dollars and then his lyceum bureau went under. Had he not
            better sweep before his own door and let his neighbor alone? </p>

         <p>Those of my readers who are so good, so modest, had better skip this chapter, for
            it speaks about prostitution. <q>"What do you mean,"</q> asks my reader,
            <q>"are not the two sexes segregated at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>?"</q> Yes, they are, the
            men being in one building and the women in another, and the two do never mingle.
            The prostitution that exists is that which is <i>practised (sic) </i> by men among
            men or by men to boys. To make it any plainer would perhaps land me in the
            federal prison for many years, for it is unfit to print and transmit through the
            mails. That my reader shall understand the situation, I will say <q>"Get your
               Bible and read the first chapter of <a href="#stpaul">St. Pauls'</a>
               letter to the Romans, especially the 26th and 27th verses, which read as
               follows: <a href="#bible"><q>26. For this cause God gave them up
                     unto vile affections; for even their women did change the natural
                     use into that which is against nature.</q></a>
               <a href="#bible">
                  <q>27. And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the
                     woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working
                     that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense
                     of their error which was meet.</q></a></q></p>
         
         <p>Never did I imagine that a human being could thus lower himself, and if those old
            steel cells at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> or in any
            other prison for that matter, could speak, they would reveal crimes like those
            <a href="#stpaul">Saint Paul</a> writes about, crimes almost
            unbelievable, <i>practised (sic) </i> by old offenders, serving long sentences and
            being shut off from the opposite sex forever, upon the young inmates, crimes so
            black that they would make the <q>"hangers on"</q> of an oriental
            seraglio blush with shame. </p>
         
         <p>A young man thus ravished is ruined forever. <q>"How can it be
               prevented?"</q> you ask. There are two ways: first, you parents, guide
            and look after your boys and keep them out of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>; second, segregate those
            unfortunate boys who have to go there, from the old sodomists by erecting
            reformatories for these young men, where each individual boy can be watched and
            each individual case receive that particular treatment which is most necessary.
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> speaks of this in his report, and
            Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a> in his message asked the
            legislators to appropriate funds for such a reformatory, which they did, and
            soon our state is to have such an institution. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
         
         <h1>WORK AT THE PRISON</h1>
         
         
         <p>Idleness, the root of all evil, is unknown at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">big prison</a>; everybody works except the
            sick in the hospital. Of the three hundred and fifty men, fifty work in the
            chair factory, one hundred and fifty in the broom and brush factories and the
            others work around the institution and as trusties on the farm and for
            outsiders. The chair and broom factories are run by corporations, in no way
            connected with the state. They buy the labor of the inmates and pay at the rate
            of fifty-five cents per day for each man, and an additional five cents for each
            man per day, which pays for rent, heat, light and power. Much has been said
            against contract labor, and while it has its defects, in interfering with
            outside labor yet it also has its good points. Many industries have been tried
            and found wanting, such as the manufacture of harness, pearl buttons,
            agricultural implements and shirts, while one industry has proven itself well
            adapted for prison work, the manufacturing of brooms and whisk brooms. It is not
            hard work, is clean and easily learned. A certain task is set and what is made
            over and above the task is paid for and placed to the prisoner's credit in the
            prison bank. The highest amount paid for overtime in the broom factory was
            thirty-three dollars for one month, but only a few earn that much, and I judge
            the average to be about three dollars per month. The dealings with the owners of
            the broom factory have been satisfactory to the state as well as to the inmates.
            The superintendent, Mr. <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a>, is a humane man
            and a gentleman. He has made very few complaints against the inmates, and on the
            other hand the inmates have made few complaints against him. </p>
         
         <p>The chair factory, an institution established a year ago, also gets along nicely.
            It is very clean, the best of sanitary conditions prevail throughout it and the
            boys have a chance to make a little money right along. Only the very finest of
            reed, rattan and fibre chairs are manufactured, some selling for over forty
            dollars, most of which are made by hand. Once a man masters this trade he can
            command high wages. </p>
         
         <p> At the last session of the legislature a law was enacted, abolishing contract
            labor in the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>, and thirty
            thousand dollars were appropriated towards establishing a binder twine plant.
            That amount is but a drop in the ocean when it comes to building a twine
            factory. Other states have these plants, and an investment of nearly a quarter
            of a million dollars has been needed of which one-third was used for buildings
            and machinery, one-third for working capital and one-third for sisal, the raw
            material. Owing to the perpetual revolutions in <a href="#mexico">Mexico</a> where the sisal is raised, it becomes necessary to buy it in
            large quantities or sometime not get any. </p>
         
         <p>A large warehouse is needed and same should, for safety's sake, be built outside
            the walls or it will be necessary to pay a heavy insurance premium on sisal
            stored in this warehouse. One of the states that went to this large expense has
            a modern and money making twine plant, but when running to its full capacity, it
            employs only seventeen convicts. I doubt if this state will spend a quarter of a
            million dollars to employ seventeen of its wards. Far better would it be for the
            state to use the thirty thousand dollars towards purchasing the chair factory
            when its contract expires. This plant already employs between fifty and sixty
            men and is on the increase all the time. As there is no other factory of this
            kind in the state, it would in no way interfere with outside labor. This factory
            could, if acquired, be used for those men who were not admitted to the outside. </p>
         
         <p>Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, in his report, to the governor,
            suggested that the state buy several tracts of land adjacent to the prison on
            which to raise vegetables. Several of these tracts could be bought, one of which
            could be irrigated in case of <i>drouth (sic) </i>. On this the warden would work
            the young men, and the first offenders, and raise small fruits and vegetables in
            abundance. While the prison now cultivates over two hundred acres of land yet
            they buy large quantities of canned fruit and vegetables and many loads of
            potatoes. With this land, and a small canning plant which could be established
            for less than five hundred dollars, much money could be saved, and good healthy
            work found for many of the men. </p>
         
         <p>In no other department of the prison is there room for as many improvements as
            there is on the farm. Reformers say <q>"Why do not the poor prisoners get a
               little milk once in a while?"</q> Well, reformers say so much and do so
            little. It is easy to say a thing, but hard to do it, and it seems to be easier
            to attend to other people's business than to mind one's own. For the benefit of
            the readers I shall explain why the boys at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> do not get any milk. First of all, the cows are not as good
            milkers as they should be; second, because half of the cows are dry half of the
            time; and third, because there has never been sufficient funds. on hand with
            which to organize a dairy along modern lines. Seldom more than twelve cows are
            milked, and these supply milk for the forty-two guards and employees and for the
            families of the warden and the deputy warden. In order to go around, it becomes
            necessary to measure the milk and cream most carefully. Frequently the officers
            drink their coffee without cream for there is not enough. I know from experience
            that at my table there was never any cream and I had to use water on my
            breakfast food and drink black coffee. <q>"But why in the world don't you
               feed lots of eggs to the boys?"</q> said one of these good women to me
            one day. <q>"Well Madam, I wish you or I could lay some for the boys, for the
               chickens won't,"</q> I told her. It is strange but true that when the
            <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> had only nine hens the boys
            would bring in on an average of seven eggs a day, but when we had over one
            hundred hens the average was about seventeen. There must be something wrong
            somewhere. The <a href="#lincolnasylum">Asylum for the Insane at <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a></a> has a large and well kept poultry
            plant, and its manager, Colonel <a href="#middleton">Middleton</a> knows
            the business from start to finish, and the big <a href="#lincolnasylum">institution</a> has chickens and eggs to spare. The <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a> has just as good
            facilities and could just as well have such a plant and do away with buying
            large quantities of eggs, as well as produce the chickens served to the inmates
            on holidays. This branch would find employment for several men, as would a dairy
            plant. There is also a chance to install a hosiery plant at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Such a one could be started
            with a few machines and at a cost of less than five hundred dollars. It could
            manufacture all the hosiery used in the prison as well as that used in other
            state institutions. Employment could be found for a few men by installing a
            little printery, for the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> uses
            printed blanks in large quantities: and thus gradually and in various ways the
            prisoners could be placed in such work that would in no way interfere with labor
            on the outside. If any of the above should not meet with success we have the
            public roads, sadly in need of improvement, to fall back upon. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER NINE</h1>
         
         <h1>A HELL IN NEBRASKA</h1>
         
         
         <p>A hell on earth, a living tomb, exists within these prison walls. It is located
            in the rear of the hospital and is commonly known as the
            <q>"hole."</q> It consists of six small cells, all of which
            are dark, save for a small opening about the size of a man's hand up under the
            ceiling. There is no furniture in the hole, not even a bed, and the occupant
            sleeps upon the stone floor. He who enters here leaves all hope behind and finds
            only sorrow, misery and despair. The illustration on the back cover shows a
            prisoner strung up in the hole. It matters not what physical condition he is in,
            nor that nature demands it, he cannot move away from there, and even if he
            could, there is no toilet within his reach. It is almost unbelievable that such
            conditions exist in the twentieth century. There was but very little use made of
            the <q>"hole"</q> during the humane Warden <a href="#beemer">Beemer</a>'s administration, for he and his deputy, Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> were experienced prison men, and knew
            how to handle prisoners without it. Also the broom factory which was the only
            prison industry at that time got along nicely with its men. During Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a>'s administration things changed for the worse. A
            <a href="#chicago">Chicago</a> concern of slavedrivers, operating
            shirt factories in eleven other prisons, started also a factory at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a>, in order to make a record for himself, that he might become
            perpetual warden, was there to make a showing, cost what it might. His dream was
            to make the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>
            self-supporting, and he talked <q>"self-supporting,"</q> from
            early to late, but other than talking of it, it never became any more
            self-supporting than it ever was. The shirt factory was installed. From their
            various factories came a collection of discarded, <i>delapidated (sic) </i>
            machines, practically useless, but <q>"good enough for <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>."</q> Only five or
            six out of the eighty were good new machines. The factory was established in a
            poorly ventilated room, the men were crowded together like sardines, and the air
            was at all times permeated with the poisonous blue dust from the cloth from
            which the cheap shirts were made. It filled the mouths and the nostrils of the
            men, so that they could hardly breathe, and caused much sickness among those
            with weak lungs. Taking it as a whole, the shirt factory was a hell on earth. </p>
         
         <p>A heavy task was set, and it was impossible for the boys to make it on those old
            machines. In justice to all concerned, credit must be given Mr. <a href="#peterson">W. O. Peterson</a>, the general manager, for being a
            humane man and a gentleman in every respect: but once a week there came from
            <a href="#chicago">Chicago</a>, the Vice-President, a <a href="#cohenstein">Mr. Cohenstein</a>, and when he came there was
            trouble. As soon as he walked in, the boys would say: <q>"Well, here is the
               sheeny, there is going to be trouble here today."</q> He usually came on
            Saturdays and had the boys put in the <q>"hole"</q> over Sunday.
            He would go straight to the task sheet, make up a list of those short in their
            work and have as many put in the hole as possible. It is indeed strange that
            some brutes are heralded as humane men, and some good, humane men heralded as
            brutes and wicked sinners. Never before, nor since, have there been so many men
            sent to the hole as during Mr. <a href="#smith">Smith</a>'s
            administration. But <a href="#uncletom">Uncle Tom</a>, being an
            auctioneer, knew how to spread the salve, knew how to pose as a saint, and the
            old women <q>"soulsavers"</q> were his press agents. I do not mean
            to say that there were no good points to Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a>, on the other hand there were many, and as a purchasing agent he
            was an especially good one. For instance, the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> uses wood in large quantities,
            and no warden before or after him bought wood at such close figures as did Mr.
            <a href="#smith">Smith</a>. There are several other articles that he
            bought at great bargains. </p>
         
         <p>A memorandum was kept at the shirt factory of all who were short in their work,
            and as soon as one gang was turned out of the <q>"hole"</q>
            another was turned in, and there was always a waiting list. If this good, humane
            warden had remained there for another term, it would have been necessary to
            build an addition to this hole. </p>
         
         <p>At noontime a guard comes along with two slices of bread and a cup of water, and
            that is your dinner. You are let down just long enough to eat this, and then you
            are strung up again. At night he is let down to partake of the same kind of a
            meal, and then sleeps on the stone floor, usually with his coat for a mattress,
            and his shoes for a pillow, for company, there are plenty of large roaches, mice
            and centipedes. After he has spent the required time in the hole, he is told to
            go and make a task or he will go back for a longer trip. He is permitted to go
            and take a bath and have a change of clothes, which is necessary on account of
            lack of sanitary arrangements in the hole. How he enjoys that bath and those
            clean clothes, even if they are second handed, and perhaps worn by a negro or a
            person with a disease! Do you think, my reader, that he will ever forget the
            hole as long as he lives? Upon the wall of the corridor one of these
            unfortunates wrote with a wire nail: </p>
         
         <q>
            
            "Here in this pen there is a place<br></br>
            Far worse than inquisition<br></br>
            Where judgment is a damning lie<br></br>
            That leads us to perdition.<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            
            A man is slowly tortured here<br></br>
            Within this hall of horror<br></br>
            As shrieks of anguish testify<br></br>
            As witness of his terror.<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            
            You scoundrels, rascals, villains, fiends<br></br>
            You demons proud and clever<br></br>
            Who drain a convict's life and blood,<br></br>
            May you go to hell forever."<br></br>
            
            </q>
         
         <p>But what is the difference if a few convicts become paralyzed or crippled for the
            rest of their lives, just so that the <a href="#chicago">Chicago</a>
            slavedrivers fill their coffers and the dream of the warden comes true? Now some
            of these <q>"soulsavers"</q> will tell you that I am not telling
            the truth, and for you to go and take a look at the punishment records of <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>; but I am telling you the
            truth, and will prove it to you. According to law, the warden must keep a
            punishment record, in which all punishments must be entered, but did Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a> do it? No; once in a while his chief clerk would
            awaken from his peaceful slumber in his little corner of the office and quit
            slobbering tobacco juice just long enough to make one or two entries. Perhaps
            there was one entry for every fifty that should have been entered. Take for
            instance when the negro, <a href="#prince">Prince</a>, was tried for the
            murder of Deputy Warden <a href="#davis">Davis</a>, the court called for a
            record to show that he was severely punished at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. Notwithstanding that he entered
            into a conspiracy to kill a guard and to liberate a negro murderer under
            sentence of death, and for which he received the worst punishment that he could
            be given, that of a long stay in the hole, and the wearing of striped suit and
            ball and chain; and there was applied to him also the water cure; there was no
            trace of this entered upon the records, and like this, others were also omitted. </p>
         
         <p>It is a long road that has no turn. After <a href="#smith">Tom Smith</a>,
            came a gentleman, a man with a heart and soul, <a href="#delahunty">James
               Delahunty</a>, under who's administration the <a href="#chicago">Chicago</a> slavedrivers did not last long, for, as they said to Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, <q>"If we cannot get these men
               punished, we cannot make any money, and we shall retire as soon as our
               contract expires."</q>
            <q>"You may retire now,"</q> said the <a href="#delahunty">warden</a>, and during the month of June, 1911, they packed their trunks
            and left <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a> for good. After Mr.
            <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> was murdered, there came Warden
            <a href="#melick">Melick</a> who discontinued the use of the
            "hole," and kept the keys in his possession; but that is another
            story and you will read about it in another chapter. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER TEN</h1>
         
         <h1>TRUE CHRISTIAN FRIENDS</h1>
         
         
         <p>No sooner has the judge pronounced sentence upon the prisoner than some one
            commences to undo the sentence by helping the prisoner out of the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</a>. Strange to say that the
            greater the crime the more people there are on hand to come to the rescue of the
            prisoner. Women, especially rush to the aid of the most notorious prisoners,
            especially murderers and rapists. Why do they do it? Some do it because of real,
            true sympathy, and because like the great Master did, they also visit and
            comfort those who are in jail. These are the people I shall tell you about in
            this chapter. </p>
         
         <p>A different kind of people are always ready to come and call on the prisoner. And
            why do they do it? For the notoriety there is in it, for the sake of satisfying
            their curiosity and perhaps for what graft there is in it. Of these
            <q>"would-be soul savers"</q> shall tell you in a following
            chapter. To tell the many good deeds done for these brothers in distress by the
            good people would require a book much larger than this, so I will only mention
            their names. First of all, I wish to mention my friend and also the friend of
            every officer and inmate, Mr. <a href="#roseborough">John M.
               Roseborough</a>, Professor at the <a href="#university">State
               University</a>. He is a splendid young man, and his heart is in the right
            place. Often has he hurried from his office, disregarding snow and rain, that he
            could work with the boys during the evening. Then there is <a href="#auld">Professor Auld</a> of <a href="#collegeview">College View</a>. For
            years this good man has taught Sunday-school at the prison. At present he is
            working hard and faithfully to obtain clemency for <a href="#andy">Andrew
               Hawkins</a>, the oldest inmate of the pen. Poor old <a href="#andy">Andy</a> has been there for nearly fourteen years, being sent up from
            <a href="#frontiercounty">Frontier County</a> for murder. To the
            officials around the prison it appears that poor old <a href="#andy">Andy</a> is innocent and was just made the <q>"fall
               guy"</q> for the real murderers. Another good friend to the boys,
            especially those from <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>, is Mr. <a href="#sigler">Harry Sigler</a>, superintendent of a charitable
            institution of that city. Mr. <a href="#sigler">Sigler</a> has come in
            contact with criminals of all kinds, large and small, young and old, and can
            judge a person at first sight. He knows their shortcomings, their peculiarities
            and even their slang. I remember the first sermon that Mr. <a href="#sigler">Sigler</a> preached at the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>. As the boys sat before him he recognized many familiar faces
            and he made a direct appeal to them to do better, to lead cleaner lives when
            they were liberated. He brought many a word into his sermon that you will not
            find in the dictionary and was not understood by the outsiders attending church
            that morning, but were known to those who have spent a long time in crime. They
            listened to and appreciated that sermon more than any sermon they had ever heard
            behind the bars. Seldom has a star of the footlights received more applause than
            did Mr. <a href="#sigler">Sigler</a> on that winter morning. Officers and
            visitors pressed forward to shake hands with this true friend. The inmates as
            they bade good-bye to Mr. <a href="#sigler">Sigler</a> asked: <q>"When
               will you be with us again?"</q> A man who has done much good in a quiet
            way is Judge <a href="#judgeengland">W. H. England</a>. The <a href="#judgeengland">judge</a> lives in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> and is too well known for me to chronicle his many good
            deeds, suffice it to say that he stands as a mighty power for all that is good
            and true. For many years Mr. <a href="#enix">J. E. Enix</a> has sacrificed
            much of his valuable time to come to the prison and act as instructor to the
            choir. No man ever did more good among the colored population than has the <a href="#may">Reverend May</a>, of the <a href="#lincolncolbaptistchurch">
               <i>Colored (sic) </i> Baptist Church of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a></a>. Mr. <a href="#may">May</a> does his good work in
            a quiet unpretentious way, and many a boy has found his <i>Saviour (sic) </i>
            through the good work of Doctor <a href="#may">May</a>. As I pass the <a href="#lincolncolbaptistchurch">church</a> and humble cottage that
            serves as parsonage for this <a href="#may">minister</a>, I often wish
            that I was rich and could either build a new one or repair this parsonage which
            is about ready to fall to pieces. You rich men and women of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, here is a suggestion for you. </p>
         
         <p>Many good women have come to the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a>
            and have talked and read for the boys. First of all comes an angel in human
            form, our beloved <a href="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</a>. Her earthly home
            is in <a href="#tabor">Tabor</a>, <a href="#iowa">Iowa</a>, and her
            other home will soon be in heaven for she is getting well along in years. She is
            known from coast to coast, and for many years has been scattering sunshine among
            the prisoners in every penitentiary in the <a href="#unitedstates">country</a>. Her hair is as white as snow and her heart is purer than
            gold; she is indeed a true servant of the Lord. Years ago when this good woman
            first started out on the road, she went to the general passenger agents of the
            railroads and asked for passes. Sometimes the passes were slow in coming, but
            <a href="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</a> kneeled down upon the floor and
            sang a hymn and prayed to the Lord that He would turn the heart of the official
            that she might go and see her boys. She never left the office without a pass,
            and today <a href="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</a> receives, without asking
            from the railroad companies, passes that carry her from coast to coast. Even big
            corporations possess a soul and a heart, and long ago they learned of the good
            done by this woman. On her last visit to <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>, she was very weak and feeble and had a nurse with her. I
            asked if she had not better lay off and take a rest for a few weeks, but she
            told me that she could not do it, for <q>"I must call on my boys"</q> she
            said. News travels fast even behind prison walls, and soon the boys learned that
            <a href="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</a> was with them and there was joy
            in every heart, even in that of those who had never seen her before for they
            knew about her and her work. There were tears in many eyes as the good <a href="#wheaton">mother</a> asked the boys to sing "Nearer my God to
            Thee," for the boys realized that before long their good mother would be
            with God in heaven. When the service is over, this good woman takes her place at
            the door, shakes hands with every inmate and asks the Lord to bless them. A true
            and well meant blessing indeed. </p>
         
         <p>Frequently Mrs. <a href="#morrison">Bessie Gerhart Morrison</a> comes to
            the <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</a> and entertains the boys. A
            noble woman indeed is Mrs. <a href="#morrison">Morrison</a> and possessed
            of much common sense. The boys look forward to her coming as one of their
            greatest treats. The <a href="#revstorm">Reverend Doctor Storm</a> and his
            daughter, <a href="#ruthstorm">Miss Ruth</a>, deserve much praise for
            their work. <a href="#ruthstorm">Miss Storm</a> is the prison pianist,
            without pay. <a href="#wheeler">Mrs. Wheeler</a> is another good friend of
            the prisoners, and so is <a href="#parke">Mrs. Parke</a>. I like the
            method of <a href="#parke">Mrs. Parke</a>; never does this good woman
            force religion upon a prisoner, but she acts slowly and deliberately. She
            appeals rather to a few at a time and gradually gains their confidence and
            friendship. When the proper time comes, she talks with them about spiritual
            affairs, and in this way <a href="#parke">Mrs. Parke</a> has done a world
            of good among the boys. Several have found the blessed <i>Saviour (sic) </i>
            through her earnest efforts, and every one of these boys has gone out and made
            good. Three of them live in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> and are highly
            respected citizens, an ornament to the community. May the good Lord grant this
            worthy <a href="#parke">woman</a> many years to continue to serve the
            Master. Many other good men and women have come forward to help lighten the
            burden of the boys in gray, and when the final roll is called the Lord will find
            a place for these good people close to the throne. </p>

         <h1> CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
         
         <h1>THE CHAPLAIN AT THE PEN </h1>
         
         
         <p> The spiritual welfare of the prisoners is looked after by two chaplains, a
            Catholic and a Protestant chaplain. Of these the former is paid nothing and the
            latter the princely sum of fifty dollars per month.For many years the <a href="#moran"> Reverend Robert F. Moran</a> has been the Catholic
            chaplain, and no matter how the blizzards and storms raged, no matter how cold
            it may be, <a href="#moran">Father Moran</a> was always at his unpaid post
            of duty. As time passed by I came to love and admire this noble priest for his
            sacrifices, for his good work and for his splendid personality. I am not a
            Catholic, but in my boyhood days I was taken severely ill and spent two months
            at one of their hospitals. Never shall I forget the kindness of those holy
            sisters who took care of me. I remember one day that I thought that I had
            sufficient strength to walk across the room but found myself too weak and
            collapsed upon the floor. Two of these sisters found me and gently carried me to
            my bed. Since that time never a year has gone by but what I have contributed to
            this great organization. I have for years come in contact with many Catholic men
            and women and have found more sincerity, more true worshippers among their faith
            than among any other. For a fact I have not found one hypocrite, one agitator or
            one conspirator among them. It has given me special pleasure from week to week
            to destroy that lying cowardly sheet, published at <a href="#aurora">
               Aurora, Missouri</a>, and sent for distribution among the inmates; and I
            wish that those cowards, those imps of hell who publish this rotten paper, may,
            before they depart for their proper hole in hell, meet with sickness and be
            attended by one of those holy sisters that they so shamefully abuse in their
            hellish publication. Would not their hearts fill with shame? No, these cowards
            have neither shame nor honor within them.</p>
         
         <p> But to return to the Catholic chaplain, I should like to call the attention to
            the good work done by him to the legislators and members of <a href="#boardofcontrol"> the board of control</a>. Go and see for
            yourselves, and ask yourselves, <q>"would it not be wise, would it not be a
               good investment to appropriate sufficient funds to employ a paid Catholic
               chaplain, that could live at the prison and devote his whole time to his
               work?"</q> You will find that he can accomplish immeasurable good for the
            reformation of character and maintainance of discipline. Other prisons have a
            Catholic chaplain, why not Nebraska?</p>
         
         <p>The Protestant chaplain, who, by the way is also librarian and schoolmaster, as I
            have stated, draws a salary of fifty dollars per month, which is really the
            salary of a fifth-class preacher. Is it a wonder that such a specimen once in a
            while drops into that office? My reader may say, <q>"Well, is not any old
               preacher good enough for the convicts?"</q> and my answer is
            <q>"NO,"</q> most emphatically <q>"NO."</q> This office,
            although underpaid, is one of the most important offices in the state. No man
            has a greater opportunity to do good, real good, than has this chaplain; no one
            has greater opportunity to build up character than has he; no one can tear down
            character and destroy discipline more than he can, if he is thus inclined. To
            make a success, he should go hand in hand with the warden, and sustain him, no
            matter what is the religion of the warden. If the chaplain works underhandedly
            against the warden, my advice to the warden is to go and take out some life
            insurance, and do so quickly, for it means good-bye to discipline and leaves the
            road open to murder and riot. The chaplain should visit <em>all</em> the boys on Sunday afternoon, and not spend
            hours with one or two notorious, murderous <em>desperadoes
               </em>. He need not talk to them in modulated voice for there is no secret
            to religion, and to religion only should he confine himself. He should not worry
            over the funds or the condition of the funds and of the books, for there are
            clerks to keep them and a warden to check the clerks, and again a state auditor
            to check the warden. Nor should he worry how much each individual inmate has on
            deposit, for they have earned it in the sweat of their brows and it is theirs
            and theirs only. Should he discover any error on the part of the warden, would
            it not be best for him to go direct to the warden, and talk it over, face to
            face, man to man, instead of going around town and secretly, underhandedly
            advertise some grievance or some imaginary grievance? To make a long story
            short, he should remember that he is there as chaplain, not as warden. He should
            attend to his own business only.</p>
         
         <p>The first chaplain that I knew at Lancaster was the <a href="#huff">Reverend
               James Huff</a>, who served under <a href="#smith"> Warden Smith</a>.
            The warden was a Catholic and the chaplain a Mormon, yet they worked hand in
            hand and got along nicely. Good old <a href="#huff">Chaplain Huff</a> was
            loved by all, officers, guards and inmates alike, for he was a good, sincere and
            true man. Once in a while he would preach a Mormon sermon, and it would be
            something new to the boys and they would enjoy it so much. I remember an inmate
            by the name of <a href="#murphy"> Murphy</a>, who in his particular way
            was a good fellow, yet was as rough as they make 'em. <a href="#murphy">
               Murphy</a> believed not in heaven nor in hell and never spoke to the
            chaplain. I was much surprised to see <a href="#murphy"> Murphy</a>
            approach the chaplain one Sunday. This is what I heard him say: <q>"Doc, you
               knows that I never bother any of you church people, and I ain't no saint,
               nor do I profess to be one, see! But I am here to tell you that the sermon
               you preached today about the Mormons and the guy with the eight wives, is
               the best that was ever preached in this or any other penitentiary that I've
               ever been at. Did you see some of them tough mugs sit up and take notice?
               Like me, they never listened to the sermons before."</q></p>
         
         <p><q>"And did you see some of the girls from down Lincoln, how interested they
               were? Chaplain, shake with me, and if ever I get religion, the Lord will
               give you credit for it."</q>
            <q>"Thank you, <a href="#frank"> Frank</a>,"</q> said the chaplain,
            <q>"you are a young man, and you will come out all right yet."</q></p>
         
         <p><a href="#huff"> Chaplain Huff</a> had no desire to be the whole show, as
            some chaplains have. No week passed by but what he looked for some good singers
            and players to come to Lancaster and entertain the boys, and he brought out some
            singers of great fame. Long will this good man be remembered at Lancaster. When
            he said good-bye to his boys, there were tears in many eyes.</p>
         
         <p>The successor, to this splendid chaplain, was one <a href="#johnson"> P. C.
               Johnson of <a href="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</a></a>, who had previously
            served a term as chaplain at the prison. During my years among many people and
            in many climes, I have become a judge of humanity and seldom do I misjudge a
            man. I looked upon him for quite a while, but failed to find one trace of mercy,
            love or kindness upon his stern old face. I shall say but little about him for I
            am unable to report one real kind act on his part. I happened to think of my
            boyhood days back east. Close to our home was a small lake surrounded by tall
            elm trees. One, especially, was a large and beautiful tree and between that and
            another, I put up my hammock. Lying in it one evening, I saw an unusual sight.
            Floating in the lake was a twig of a tree, but it was floating up stream. How
            could that be? I investigated and saw a large water rat underneath the twig. I
            made a move, and the underhanded creature went to the bottom of the lake. I
            thought but little more about it at that time, only that like these rats work
            from cover, so do also some men work from under cover. Afterward there came a
            <i>drought (sic) </i>, and there was but little water in the
            lake, soon the big tree commenced to lean forward and forward, and one morning
            it fell into the lake. We found that a colony of large water rats had undermined
            the tree. Now it lies dead and gone where once it stood in all its majestic
            grandeur. I felt so sorry over the loss of the tree, for the landscape now
            looked so strange to me: and I will leave it to my reader to imagine what my
            feelings were towards the rats. While the rat covers his underhanded doings with
            a twig, many a man covers up his underhanded deeds and uses for that the cover
            of darkness, a coat of sanctimoniousness or any other cover necessary to gain
            their underhanded points. If I have a grievance against a man, like a man I will
            go to him and have a good heart to heart talk with him. In nine cases out of ten
            the trouble will be adjusted. If I work in a public institution, and dislike the
            religion, the personality or the methods of the head of the institution, why,
            instead of doing the rat act, I will simply ask for my time check, for as <a href="#Poet">the poet</a> says:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               <a href="#Poet2"></a>
               "Should we not like his company,<br></br>
               We know the world is wide."<br></br>
               </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>But I am getting away from my subject - the chaplain of the prison. Never once
            did I know of him to approach <a href="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</a> and
            in a friendly way talk matters over with him. While I knew that the warden was
            not exactly going to turn his office over to him, yet if there was anything
            within right or justice that he could have done for this man, I know that he
            would have done it. One dreary January evening the warden was telling me how the
            chaplain was working against him in an underhanded way. I asked: <q>"Well,
               Warden, why does he not come to you and have a talk with you and state his
               grievances?"</q> And the warden answered, <q>"Never once has he spoken
               to me or made a complaint of any kind. Even in the dining room he does not
               say a word; but never a week passes but what some of my friends tell me of
               his underhanded work and warn me against him."</q></p>
         
         <p>There lives in Persia an animal having small, naked ears, four toes on each
            foot,a straight jointed tail and erect hair on the neck. It is a fierce, cruel
            and untamable animal. You have seen it in the menagerie, always nervous, always
            restless, always shifting about. It is the hyena. As long as you live he will
            never attack you; he will run away from you; but as soon as you are dead and in
            your grave, he will sneak towards it under the cover of the night and devour
            your dead body. I have known of a man doing the hyena act, by attacking a dead
            man's honor after he is laid in his grave. I have known of a man doing this act
            in one of our depots; and I know another, now in public office, who stepped
            toward him and said: <q>"How would you like, when you are dead and gone, to
               have me stand in a public place like this, and tell a bunch of men what I
               know of you?"</q></p>
         
         <p>I must again apologize to my reader for getting away from my original story. <a href="#johnson"> Chaplain Johnson</a> once disappeared and was gone for
            three days.<q>"The good man has too much religion upon his mind,"</q> said
            the fake religionists. <q>"Let us hope that he never gets back,"</q> said
            the officers and inmates; but he did come back. As he is a state official and a
            public servant, would it not be interesting to the public at large to have him
            explain where he was? When Jesus disappeared from his friends, he was found
            praying within the temple. In what kind of a place was this reverend gentleman
            found, and who found him? I happen to think of an old rhyme:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               <a href="#Poet2"></a>
               "In speaking of a person's faults<br></br>
               Pray, don't forget your own.<br></br>
               Remember those in houses of glass<br></br>
               Should seldom throw a stone."<br></br>
               </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>I take much pleasure in telling you about an ideal prison chaplain. When the
            governor had accepted Mr. Johnson's <q>"resignation"</q> he set
            about to locate his successor. The governor moved slowly in this matter for he
            realized how important it was to find the right sort of a man, a man who would
            build up and not tear down, a man who would be a friend to all of the boys and
            not to three or four <em>desperadoes</em>, one who would
            be chaplain and not attempt to be warden, a man who was a true Christian
            gentleman, and not a hypocrite. Such a man was found in the person of <a href="#harmon"> Reverend Nathan T. Harmon</a>, pastor of the <a href="#christianchurchdavidcity">Christian Church of <a href="#davidcity">David City</a></a> The governor had known him
            for years, and had attended his church. On the following Sunday he. presented
            his credentials to <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a> and received
            a hearty welcome. The new chaplain went into the church and soon the warden
            followed. <q>"Warden,"</q> I said, <q>"are you not forgetting your
               morning paper?"</q> The warden of the prison always attends church as a
            precautionary measure; that is, he sits in the deputy warden's office in the
            corner of the chapel. The warden always used to take with him a copy of the
            "Lincoln Sunday Star."
            <q>"No, my boy, this young preacher looks good to me and I am going to listen
               to his sermon."</q> Like the warden, so did the boys also like the
            chaplain, from the very start. <q>"How did you like the sermon?"</q> I
            asked the warden. <q>"I liked every word of it. That man is made of the right
               stuff,"</q> said the warden. <q>"He will do no underhanded work
               against us."</q> In the afternoon the new chaplain went from cell to
            cell. Some of the old timers, who used to feign sleep when the former chaplain
            came around were at the door waiting to shake hands with their new friend.
            <q>"Chaplain,"</q>said a long time holdup man, <q>"that sermon you
               preached today went right to the hearts of us fellows. If I live eleven more
               months I shall be a free man again and I am going to do what is
               right."</q>
            <q>"There is something to this chaplain that I like,"</q> said a life
            timer to me. <q>"He preaches of the good and beautiful, about God and the
               great home above us; and it sounds good, for we have had plenty of hell and
               damnation for over a year."</q> Were I to chronicle here the many good
            deeds done by <a href="#harmon">Mr. Harmon</a>, this book would be much
            too small. Suffice it to say that he made friends with all the men and many a
            soul was saved through his good work. When a year later another governor was
            elected the boys were much worried over <a href="#harmon">Mr. Harmon</a>
            losing his office, but their worries and suspense was turned to joy when the
            Star announced his appointment as <a href="#harmon">Deputy
               Warden</a> for they knew that he would continue to give them a square
            deal; and so he did, and he turned out to be as successful and efficient a
            deputy as the prison ever had.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
         
         <h1>FAKE RELIGIONISTS. LONG DISTANCE REFORMERS </h1>
         
         
         <p>While the good work done among the prisoners by the true Christian men and women
            is immeasurable, at the same time the work done by the ever increasing army of
            <q>"would-be reformers,"</q> fake religionists, gushing
            sentamentalists, female convict lovers and blabbering gossippers does more to
            destroy the prison discipline than anything else and makes life an everlasting
            burden for the prison officials and guards. <q>"There is no doubt",</q>
            says a Clay county paper, <q>"that the murder of the prison officials may be
               traced to the unrest caused by the mistaken zeal of the 'alleged reformer'
               who has been hounding the governor for the removal of the warden who laid
               down his life in the service of the state."</q> And the paper told the
            truth. Likewise did the "Lincoln Herald", a weekly that knows not what
            fear is. The publisher was formerly a prison official and is in my opinion the
            best posted newspaper man in the state as far as prison doings are concerned.
            Time and time again he has called the public's attention to the menace of these
            workers, and in the issue following the murder of the officials, says:
            <q>"The cruel murder of <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a>,
               <a href="#wagner">Deputy Warden Wagner</a>, <a href="#heilman"> Usher Heilman</a>, and the wounding of <a href="#doody">
                  Cellkeeper Doody</a> at the state prison Thursday, is chargeable
               directly and primarily to prison reformers, religionists and outside
               influences, all of which destroys discipline and works a menace to the
               prison officials."</q> And the "Lincoln Herald" is right as it
            always is. This paper always tells the truth. Its sympathies are with the under
            dog, and as long as you are right this paper is with you and for you with all
            its might; but if you are wrong, be you president or pauper, rich or poor, big
            or small, it is likewise against you. When I received my "Herald" I read
            this article to an official much in sympathy with the
            <q>"reformers,"</q> not because they were
            <q>"reformers,"</q> but because they were females (he was very
            fond of the opposite sex), and said: <q>"There at least is one publisher who
               has the nerve to tell the truth."</q>
            <q> "Well,"</q> he drawled, <q>"that is only a little weekly and is not
               in sympathy with the reform movement."</q>
            <q> "No, you are right,"</q> I answered, <q>"it never was, and never
               will be in sympathy with liars, hypocrites and murderers."</q> I sat down
            and sent the publisher my check and asked to be notified when to renew, and as
            long as I live I shall continue to subscribe for this noble paper. Now naturally
            my reader will say, <q>"If these people are so destructive to prison
               discipline, why does the warden permit them to come?"</q> I will tell you
            why. This gang of <i>fakers (sic) </i> consists of about three fake
            preachers or self-constituted evangelists, and seven or eight women. They
            commenced to come to the prison several years ago, but under <a href="#beemer">Warden Beemer's</a> administration they were much
            restricted. When <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> took office this gang
            held free sway and high carnival at the pen. Services over with they went to the
            officers' dining room and were fed. From there they would go to the cell houses
            and unrestricted visit from cell to cell. Is it a wonder that the prison was
            full of <q>"dope"</q>? And did the prisoners appreciate these
            women? Some much preferred after a week's hard work to take a rest on Sunday
            afternoon. Others were much pleased to see these women come around, not because
            they were soul savers, but because they were women. I will give you an
            illustration. I passed one of these women on a gallery. She was a woman of
            forty-five or fifty, no spring chicken by any means, yet she was dressed like a
            seventeen-year-old. She was reading to a young man, a recent arrival, about the
            prodigal son and the fatted calf. Was he interested? Yes, in a way; but as he
            listened to her reading I noticed his eyes would rove toward a well turned ankle
            clad in heliotrope hose. No matter how much she read about the prodigal, his
            eyes would drift toward the ankle. And was he to blame? Man after all is but a
            weak animal, and those poor penned-up boys are perhaps a little weaker than
            their brothers on the outside. This boy had just arrived from a county jail,
            where he had lain for weeks and had never seen or talked with a woman, and while
            she was old enough to be his mother, he, like the sailor in mid-ocean to whom
            any port looks good in a storm, became much interested in her, not because she
            was reading the Bible to him, not because she was trying to save his soul, but
            because she was a woman or as I should rather say--a female. And as he laid upon
            his prison bed that afternoon, rolling to and fro, did he think of the prodigal
            and the fatted calf? No, another calf was on his mind, a pretty one clad in
            heliotrope. Lord, lead us not into temptation! And you women from <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln,</a> I mean you curosity seekers, you who have
            forty churches down town, but nevertheless have to come to the prison church,
            don't put on your slit gowns. Make as little display of hose and ankles as
            possible. Have a little mercy on those poor penned-up creatures out there. I
            hope you see the point. The thoughts that these female
            <q>"reformers"</q> and these female curosity seekers have
            caused to come to the minds of the men out there have caused much misery and
            suffering, especially to those with insufficient will power to control their
            feelings, and made them into physical and mental wrecks. So, if you, my reader,
            when standing upon the corner of Tenth and 0 streets should notice a thin and
            haggard looking man, a discharged prisoner, alight from the
            <q>"penitentiary"</q> car, do not blame his appearance to
            being underfed or abused by the officials, for there is another reason.</p>
         
         <p>Gradually as the power of this gang increased the prison discipline decreased and
            the penitentiary became the laughing stock of experienced prison men. Criminals
            throughout the country referred to it as the <q>"Playhouse",</q>
            the <q>"Haven of Rest",</q> or the
            <q>"Kindergarten."</q>
            <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> was fond of these
            <q>"reformers",</q> for above all things he is a shrewd
            politician and in his campaign for the governorship or for perpetual warden,
            these women became very useful auxiliaries. For a fact, they circulated a
            petition to the legislators to retain him, for well did they know that if <a href="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</a> was appointed warden there would be
            no more dinners at the state's expense.</p>
         
         <p>Far more dangerous, far more poisonous than the sting of the rattler, is the
            sting of the evil tongues; for while the sting of the snake is usually overcome
            or cured, that of evil tongues may last a lifetime, may follow a person to his
            grave. To these tattlers and meddlers, a man's integrity or a woman's honor
            amounts to very little, just so that they gain their point. <a href="#mason">Walt Mason</a> says:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               "If you lie about your neighbors,<br></br>
               Then the wages of your labors,<br></br>
               Will be deathless scorn and hate.<br></br>
               Telling stories not demanded;<br></br>
               Doing actions underhanded,<br></br>
               Finally will see you landed<br></br>
               Where pariahs congregate."<br></br>
               </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>And I hope that Walt is right. Speaking about that place reminds me of a show I
            saw at the <a href="#majestic">"Majestic"</a> in Chicago a few years ago,
            entitled <cite>"The Devil and Tom Walker."</cite> That show caused
            me to stop, ponder and reflect. It set me to studying more than if all the
            preachers in our city would preach to me for years to come. Before you is a
            subterranean grotto, representing hades, fire and sulphur sparks flying in all
            directions. A new arrival comes sliding down a shute. It is a negro, Mr. Tom
            Walker, from Memphis, Tennessee. Tom is thirsty and grabs a schooner, but
            instead of beer out comes burning flames. <q>"Tom," says the devil, "I am
               going down on earth, and I am going to put you in charge while I am gone."
               "Before you go, Mr. Devil, just tell me one thing. Billy Williams, our
               sheriff was sick when I left the earth; has he come here yet?" "No, but I
               look for him here today," says the king of hades, "and I wish you would take
               good care of him." "Indeed I shall," says Tommy, "he has arrested me so
               often for shooting craps that I shall give him special attention." Satan
               departs and Tom turns to a little female imp and asks, "Which is the worst
               department in this place." "Ah, the skunk oil bath," she says.</q> Soon
            the sheriff arrives, is promptly set over there, and you hear him groan when the
            imps of hell tickle his ribs with their pronged forks. That picture often comes
            back to my memory and I think there would be no better place for those
            hypocrites who, with their lying, poisonous tongues and underhanded work, caused
            the death of four of our brave prison officials. If a warden objects to these
            people and their methods, the <q>"gang"</q> will call upon the
            governor or the state officials and tell what a wicked sinner, what an infidel,
            what a monster the warden is, and that he ought to be removed. If the governor
            has too much sense to pay attention to these <i>fakers (sic) </i>
            why, then there is another way, the way used on that fatal day of February and
            again on that wintry day of March - bloody murder.</p>
         
         <p>I must also introduce you to another specimen of the same tribe, less numerous,
            but not less poisonous. These are the long distance reformers, by themselves
            called <q>"prison experts";</q> and some of them even call
            themselves <q>"international prison experts."</q> The funny part
            of it is that none of them were ever connected with a prison. They live an easy
            life and their graft is a good one. They sit in their home, usually in some
            large eastern city, and write articles about prison reform and prisons, yet they
            never saw the prisons they write about. For the benefit of my readers, as well
            as for the benefit of the publishers who are foolish enough to accept their
            slush as the truth, and publish it, I will show how they work. The
            <q>"expert"</q> sits down and writes to every prison warden
            for his latest report. Every prison publishes such a report every two years.
            There is much good reading in them, and many illustrations. They show the
            progress made at the prison since the last report was published. With these
            reports before him, it is easy enough for the <q>"expert"</q> to
            build a magazine article, which he trims with a liberal amount of hot air, which
            he did not have to send away for. Then he catches a publisher. It is a pity that
            two of our leading magazines within the last year have been caught by one of
            these sharks. The publisher prints this stuff, the public reads it and condemns
            the management of the prison. If you tell them that it is not the truth, the
            answer will be: "It must be the truth, for don't you see it was written by a
            'prison expert"'?</p>
         
         <p>I have never been much in favor of sending stuff to these fellows, but as one of
            them kept on writing me I finally sat down one evening and worked until midnight
            to get together the information he asked for. While he gets fancy prices from
            the publishers, yet he never saw fit to waste a stamp on me to acknowledge
            receipt of my letters. After waiting a month I wrote him and asked if he had
            received it. The following letter was received which speaks for itself, and
            exposes the methods of these men:</p>

            WASHINGTON, D. C., FEB. 28, 1913.
            MR. <a href="#wilson">WALTER WILSON</a>,
            Lancaster, Nebr.
            
            
            <p>DEAR SIR: I have yours of the 24th and beg to apologize most profoundly
               for my failure to acknowledge receipt of your earlier letters and
               clippings. The delay was due to the very interesting nature of the
               material, the hurried reading of which raised so many questions in my
               mind that I was impelled to put the matter aside until I should have had
               full opportunity to give it the careful reading that it deserved and to
               put to you the questions that occurred to me. Unfortunately I have been
               so rushed with a variety of other matters that the opportunity longed
               for has not yet arrived. I shall limit myself to a hasty and apologetic
               acknowledgement, and to the expression of the hope that you will
               continue to send me such information as you may deem it of importance
               for me to possess.</p>
            
            <br>Very truly yours,</br>
            <br>(Signed) J. <a href="#leavitt">LEAVITT</a>.</br>
            
            </div>
         
         
         <p>This is the same <q>"expert"</q> who wrote those blood and thunder
            articles in two of our leading magazines a few months ago. You see now how he
            gets his material. The original of this letter is on file in my office and any
            of my readers are welcome to call and see it. I wish to inform my readers that
            there is as much difference between the real conditions and those described by
            this <q>"expert"</q> as there is between the glorious sun and a
            coal oil lamp. Some of his stuff is the truth in a way-that is, it happened
            twenty years ago but does not happen now.</p>
         
         <p>Shortly after the outbreak the prison was honored by a visit from one of this
            style of gentry, one <a href="#gtaylor">Graham Taylor,</a> who with a
            bunch of old women edits a little magazine for the betterment of mankind at
            Chicago.</p>
         
         <p>He came here to gather material for some articles for this publication.
            <q>"Would his excellency, the governor, kindly give him a permit to see
               the prison from start to finish?"</q> Certainly our courteous and
            gentlemanly governor would grant this <q>"international
               expert"</q> a pass. So we showed him all there was to be seen. He
            went away stating that the place was not as black as it had been painted and
            that while there was room for many improvements, yet everything was as,
            satisfactory as it could be under the circumstances. Imagine our surprise when
            the next morning there was an interview in a morning paper quite to the
            contrary. The governor called the <q>"expert"</q> upon the carpet
            to explain and it was the same old story. <q>"Why, the reporters have not
               quoted me correctly."</q> Charity, as I have said before, begins at home.
            <a href="#gtaylor">Mr. Taylor </a>, why not clean up the slums of your
            own city, why not go after the vice and the white slavers in Chicago first and
            drive them out of the windy city; and when you have accomplished that, then come
            back to Nebraska and clean up here? Until you have done that, we can perhaps get
            along without you. Another <q>"expert,"</q> a regular old wolf in
            garb of a sheep, used to come to the prison. Every courtesy was shown him,
            because we took him to be a sincere and good man. Much to our surprise, there
            appeared in an Omaha paper an interview with him, stating that convicts were
            underfed and that the meat served was unfit to eat, while those inmates who had
            money, bought from the prison meat cutter the fancy slices and cooked them in
            their cells. Soon our friend came to Lancaster. It was time for luncheon (those
            people usually happen around about meal time) and Steward Robb and our reformer
            went to luncheon together. Mr. Robb kept calling for me and I joined the two.
            There was a twinkle in Mr. Robb's eye and I knew that something was going to
            happen. I awaited developments. The luncheon was served. The prison meat cutter
            dressed in spotless white served as waiter. <q>"How about that interview the
               other day?"</q> said Mr. Robb. <q>"Well I did not refer to this
               administration,"</q> said the reformer, <q>"I meant the Delahunty
               administration."</q>
            <q>"Well,"</q> said I, <q>"there is where you and I collide, for that
               brave man lies in his grave and I will answer for him and protect him
               against such willful, malicious and uncalled for lies; furthermore, this man
               who is waiting on our table has been the prison meat cutter for over
               thirteen years. He is serving a life sentence and is trying for a pardon. Do
               you realize the injustice your Particle does to this poor man?"</q> Our
            friend replied, <q>"The fact of the matter is that the reporters either
               misquoted or misunderstood me."</q> For a few, minutes he squirmed in his
            seat, then he pulled out his watch and said, <q>"Well, I must hurry to get my
               car. So long, gentlemen."</q> This religious gentleman stays at the Y. M.
            C. A. in Omaha, except when he is out begging the good people in Nebraska for
            money with which to carry on his soul saving work. I warn people against
            contributing to these grafters. If you have money to give to sweet charity, give
            it to the poor in your own town; or if you wish to benefit the boys in prison,
            contribute to the <a href="#nebraskaprisonassociation">Nebraska Prison
               Association,</a> Little Block, Lincoln, Nebraska, an association that is
            genuine and does much good. Stay away from these traveling grafters, no matter
            what name they work under and no matter if they do come to your church and get
            permission from your minister to preach there, for while your pastor is sincere,
            the grafter is not. Leave them alone. Another specimen of this same kind, has
            come to the prison for years and has had access to the books, from which he
            copied the names of the inmates as well as their friends. He is a sanctimonious
            looking fellow, always ready to shake hands and call you
            <q>"brother."</q> Shortly after I took office, he came, and as
            usual entered the vault and took out the descriptive ledger. I watched him for a
            minute and saw him take down names in shorthand. Is it not nerve, to go into a
            public office and take out the books without even asking, and does it not show
            underhandedness to copy in shorthand? So I said, <q>"What is that you are
               copying there?"</q>
            <q> "Brother, I am just copying a few names."</q>
            <q>"Do you copy the names of all the prisoners, and why do you copy the names
               of their friends?"</q> I asked. <q>"Well brother, I just do as the
               Lord dictates me to do."</q>
            <q>"Well,"</q> said I, <q>"the Lord dictates to me that you are never
               to copy any more names as long as I am in charge."</q> He did not like
            it. While the inmates' names, their sentences, and their crimes, are public
            records, the names of their parents, brothers, sisters and friends' are not
            public property, and I look upon this as a sacred matter and felt it my duty to
            protect these people against being preyed upon by these wolves. I know of a case
            where a young man was sent to prison from the central part of the state. His
            mother was well to do. Soon she received a letter from one of these people
            stating that he could perhaps get the boy out of prison. She sent the
            <q>"soulsavers"</q> twenty dollars, yet the boy served his
            year. Since then I have incurred the wrath of this worthy gentleman as well as
            that of the gang of <q>"soulsavers"</q> who make their
            headquarters at the Ninth Street Mission in Lincoln. According to them, I am the
            wickedest sinner in the city, and while I acknowledge that I have been a sinner
            in my days, I feel now that I will sit as close to the throne as any of these
            holy ones.</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               "If they have nothing else to do<br></br>
               But talk of those who sin,<br></br>
               It is better they commence at home<br></br>
               And from the point begin."<br></br>
               </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>And before they start out to purify our institutions, let them clean their own,
            for I think that a little house cleaning would do this religious joint a world
            of good. On the second story of this mission are rooms for their converts. A
            young grass-widow whose soul was saved occupied one, and an officer of the
            mission another. It appears that the officer made a date with the grass-widow to
            call upon him in his room. Later it seems that the lady took a fancy to someone
            else, so the officer in the middle of the night slips over to the police
            station. There is a raid, and the widow and her friend are taken to the station.
            In the police court the next morning, the woman broke down and cried and was
            turned loose while the gentleman was fined. Let us hope that these people give
            more of their time to clean their own place. The trouble of it is, that some of
            them are so busy looking after other peoples' affairs that they completely
            forget their own. So busy is one woman reformer with saving souls of the
            convicts that she had not had time to wash her own face for some time; while
            another has not taken a bath for a long time, but drowns the odors of her body
            in stale perfume, Can a clean soul live in a filthy body?</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>NOTABLE INMATES </h1>
         
         
         <p>Nebraska penitentiary has had its share of criminals of fame and also some
            peculiar characters. Years ago when the territory of Wyoming sent their
            prisoners here, they sent a <a href="#chinaman">Chinaman,</a> who by the
            way, was the only Chinese ever received here. Shortly before his time expired,
            another prisoner slipped up behind him and cut off his queue. <a href="#annie">"Morphine Annie"</a> was also a guest of the institution
            some years ago. On the outside she was a snake charmer of some reputation. One
            of the most unruly women ever received was <a href="#bertha">"Fainting
               Bertha,"</a> who has served in many prisons and was once a beautiful
            woman, but much <q>"dope"</q> and many years behind the bars have
            caused <a href="#bertha">Bertha's</a> beauty to fade away. Her method was
            to locate a gentleman with a diamond stud. She would stumble against him, act as
            if she was fainting and in some way get his diamond. As soon as she got the
            stone, she revived. <a href="#bertha">Bertha</a> played her last trick of
            that kind, in Lincoln and received a sentence of five years. Shortly after
            coming to the pen, she became unmanageable and was put into a room by herself.
            This did not suit <a href="#bertha">Bertha;</a> she sent for the warden
            and told him that she was going to tear the sheets to pieces and hang herself.
            She was then locked up in the bath room; but soon she notified the warden that
            she was going to drown herself in the bath tub. She was then taken to the <a href="#insaneasylum">insane asylum</a> at <a href="#hastings">Hastings,</a> where she lingers now. Some years ago <a href="#martin">"Bert" Martin</a> was received here from <a href="#keyapahacounty">Keya Paha county</a> for horse stealing. <q>"He"</q> came
            in men's clothes, was supposed to be a man and remained for seven months in the
            men's cell building until a jealous inmate went to the warden and reported <a href="#martin">"Bert"</a> to be a woman in man's attire. <a href="#martin">"Bert"</a> had won the love of many of the boys, even of
            one of the guards, and among the many admirers had rejected the one who
            <q>"squealed."</q> The prison physician was called in and
            examined <a href="#martin">"Bert,"</a> and found him to be a person
            possessed of both sexes. It was thought best to transfer <a href="#martin">"Bert"</a> to the female department; but up there the same story repeated
            itself. All the girls fell in love with <a href="#martin">"Bert"</a> and
            there was much hair pulling and many fights for possession of
            <q>"him"</q> or <q>"her,"</q> or whatever would
            be proper to say. Finally <a href="#savage">Governor Savage</a> was called
            upon for assistance and he pardoned the prisoner.</p>
         
         <p>Recently there was received into the prison one <a href="#willoughby">Bertie
               Jessie Lee Willoughby</a>, from Omaha, for grand larceny. This young
            fellow had a smooth face and looked, talked and walked like a woman, and was an
            expert at fancy needle work. He became a trusty and worked about the officer's
            rooms. One afternoon he donned a suit of pale blue silk underwear belonging to
            <a href="#humphrey">Doctor Humphrey,</a> the assistant surgeon. The
            suit was sent the <a href="#humphrey">Doctor</a> by a college chum who
            toured the Asiatic countries and brought it from China. He then put on a suit of
            clothes belonging to <a href="#robb"> Steward Robb,</a> appropriated my
            overcoat, walked out of the prison and took a car for the city where he caught a
            freight train for Fairbury and disappeared into Kansas. We afterwards learned
            that he had served in several other pens and was wanted by the federal
            authorities for desertion from the navy and also for forgery in St. Louis. He is
            in the west at the present time and some day he will be brought back.</p>
         
         <p>Another notable was <a href="#vonwerner">"Count" Max von Werner,</a>
            claiming to be a scion of a noble German family. He was sent from Madison for
            obtaining money under false pretenses, and was to serve from one to five years.
            He was a very accomplished musician and soon gained the confidence of the
            officers, all except one, myself; for never did I believe that he was a
            <q>"Count,"</q> nor that he was a university graduate. It
            happened that</p>

            </div>
         
         
         <p><a href="#johnson">Chaplain P. C. Johnson</a> who lives at Tecumseh asked
            of <a href="#fenton">Warden Fenton</a> permission to take the
            <q>"Count"</q> home with him, that he might entertain some of
            his friends with choice music. The warden did not like it, and refused several
            times, but finally, upon the pleadings of the chaplain, permitted him to go.
            They left the prison on Monday morning and were to return on Friday evening. The
            <q>"Count"</q> took a good rest at Tecumseh, and on Thursday
            night got up and took the midnight train for Saint Joseph, Missouri. Here he
            pawned his cornet and took a car for Kansas City where he pawned his violin, and
            for a few days we lost track of him. In the meantime <a href="#fenton">Warden Fenton</a> got busy and sent the <q>"Count's"</q>
            picture to every sheriff in the country. Soon we learned that he had gone to
            Spirit Lake, Iowa, where he had bought out a store for $4,970.00, tendered a
            check for $5,000.00 and received the balance of thirty dollars in cash. He also
            bought a suit of clothes from a storekeeper and paid with a forty-dollar check.
            Then he skipped the town and for several weeks we did not hear anything about
            him. One day a wire came from Sheriff Henderson at Woodstock, Illinois, who had
            him in custody. He had tried to cash a check in that city, but the sheriff was
            too quick for him and landed him in jail. In the meantime, we learned that this
            blue blooded gentleman was a graduate from seven penitentiaries, and was wanted
            by the reformatory at Mansfield, Ohio, where he will go when his five years in
            this prison expire. As he has ten years to serve there and several charges
            against him in Iowa and Illinois the <q>"Count's"</q> future is
            not altogether a pleasant one. But then he is used to it and seems to prefer
            life behind the bars to life on the outside. He is also an artist, but as such
            he is a rank failure. He painted a picture of a landscape, a duck is flying
            across a stream, but the duck is much larger than the mountain in the picture.
            On another picture is a lion and a dog, but the dog looks more like a giraffe
            than a dog and it is a mighty fierce looking lion. The boys at Lancaster were
            glad to hear of him being caught. One of them wrote the following rhyme about
            him:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               "Oh, there was a little German man<br></br>
               <a href="#vonwerner">Von Werner</a> was his name,<br></br>
               With a brass cornet and fiddle<br></br>
               This German won great fame.<br></br>
               They sent him to Lancaster<br></br>
               To rest a little spell<br></br>
               Where they petted him and humored him<br></br>
               And fed him mighty well.<br></br>
               They said he was the finest<br></br>
               Violinist in the land.<br></br>
               They made him the little master<br></br>
               Of the Melick Concert Band."<br></br>
               </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>There lingers in Lancaster a young colored man, number 4585, who paints in oil
            and water color both. He has painted some beautiful portraits, and if any of my
            readers would like a portrait painted, it would be well to get the warden's
            permission to have him paint you one. Another genius is out there, he is a
            cartoonist, one of the best in the country, <a href="#naylor"> Mr.
               Naylor.</a> The front and back covers of this book were drawn by him in a
            few minutes. I hope some newspaper will get in touch with him and give him a
            position.</p>
         
         <p>Another notable guest lives at Lancaster, namely <a href="#stclair"> George
               St. Clair,</a> but he is not as much of a saint as the name would
            indicate. <a href="#stclair"> Mr. St. Clair</a> was sent up to serve from
            one to seven years for stealing a bolt of silk from a Lincoln department store.
            From the start he refused to attend church services, claiming that it was
            against his religious belief. Being asked what religion he professed, he said
            that he was a Jew. We called up the Rabbi and had a talk with him about it. The
            Rabbi suggested that he be a good boy and go to church, and that there was
            nothing wrong in so doing. Still <a href="#stclair"> St. Clair</a> refused
            and it was decided to place him in a dark cell every Sunday during church hours
            until he decided to go to church; but he evidently preferred the dark cell to
            the Reverend <a href="#chaplainjohnson">Johnson's</a> sermons and kept on
            refusing to go to church. He also wrote a letter to the attorney general and the
            chief justice of the supreme court, and both of these gentlemen wrote him a
            courteous letter as private individuals and advised him to obey the prison
            rules. Even that did not satisfy him, he became more and more unruly and
            disobedient and is now kept in a dark cell all the time. And what has he gained?
            He has gained exactly what he sought for, namely, a lot of newspaper notoriety
            which will do him no good. It is astonishing what some people will do in order
            to get their names into print. Had he acted like a man, he no doubt would have
            been paroled when he had served ten months; as it is now, he will perhaps remain
            at the prison for seven years.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>ESCAPES FROM THE PRISON </h1>
         
         
         <p>Every once in a while a prisoner makes his escape from the prison. Altogether one
            hundred and eight have escaped since its establishment in 1869. The first to
            escape was <a href="#hogan">James Hogan</a> who made his
            <q>"getaway"</q> way back in 1871 and was never heard of
            since. It seems almost impossible that one man could escape three times,
            nevertheless that was the case of <a href="#cwilliams">Charles
               Williams,</a> alias Jacobson. <a href="#cwilliams">Charley</a> was
            recaptured twice and was again placed as a trusty in the prison garden after
            having given <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> his word of honor that he
            would never again attempt to escape. <a href="#cwilliams">Charley</a>
            worked a few days in the garden, then under cover of the fruit trees reached the
            railroad track and again departed for parts unknown. This time he was not
            recaptured. This was <a href="#cwilliams">Charley's</a> third trip to
            Lancaster and we afterwards learned that he was wanted in four different places;
            so could you blame him for taking French leave? During the administration of
            <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> thirteen, altogether, left without
            leaving their forwarding address. Of these thirteen nine were trusties, who
            either scaled the wall or walked off, and four sawed their way to sweet liberty.
            These four were cooks and flunkies in the guards' dining room and went to work
            about four o'clock in the morning before any guards were on duty in that part of
            the building. They would utilize the early morning hours for sawing the bars a
            little now and a little then. They would carefully conceal the sawing by
            covering it with soft soap of the color of the bars. On a Sunday morning early,
            and before the warden and guards were out of bed, they quietly removed the cut
            bars and jumped out upon the lawn in front of the prison. They have never been
            heard of since. An hour later a guard came in and wanted his breakfast, but
            there was no fire in the stove and no cooks. He promptly gave the alarm and a
            posse was sent out, but without results. The papers stated that most of the
            sawing was done from the outside, but this is most ridiculous. During <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty's</a> administration five escaped,
            one from the farm, and one from the warehouse outside the walls. The latter soon
            came back from Omaha with a ten year sentence for another crime, and when this
            is finished he will start in and complete his first sentence. The other three
            dynamited and shot their way out, but one was shot dead by the sheriff's posse,
            one committed suicide and the third was captured and given a life sentence.
            During <a href="#melick">Warden Melick's</a> administration there were no
            outbreaks. Ten trusties took French leave, but five of these were recaptured
            within a few hours of their escape.</p>
         
         <p>It is strange, but nevertheless it is true, that these men who have the shortest
            sentences are the ones that usually escape.As <a href="#pinker">William
               Pinkerton,</a> the great detective says: <q>"When a tramp hears the
               whistle of the locomotive he cannot resist. He must travel."</q> The
            five who were not recaptured were all floaters or tramps, who had no home
            anywhere, and whose sentences were very short, several of them having less than
            ninety days.</p>
         
         <p>During <a href="#fenton">Warden Fenton's</a> administration and up to this
            day there has been only one escape, and he fiddled his way out. He was turned
            over to the chaplain, who lives at Tecumseh. He entertained a party of the
            chaplain's friends one night with sweet strains from his violin. He played until
            late in the night and wound up his entertainment with the music from the old
            familiar song <cite>"I Am Going Far Away."</cite> He made his good
            night bow to the audience, retired to his room, and when everything was quiet,
            departed for parts unknown. The next morning the chaplain knocked upon his door
            to tell him that break-fast was ready, but the <a href="#vonwerner">"Count"
               </a> was not there. The news was telephoned to <a href="#fenton">Warden
               Fenton,</a> who got busy and sent the nobleman's photo broadcast. Now if
            the <a href="#vonwerner">"Count"</a> had followed the straight and narrow
            path and gone to work in some small town, perhaps he never would have been
            caught, but alas, he cannot dispense with lying or crooked work. From town to
            town he went, hiring automobiles and paying for them with bad checks. He was
            just getting into a ear at Woodstock, Illinois, ready to go to Chicago, after
            cashing a bad check for thirty dollars, but he forgot to pay his hotel bill, and
            the proprietor called in Sheriff Henderson. The sheriff, who had the circular
            sent out by <a href="#fenton">Warden Fenton,</a> immediately recognized
            the nobleman, and wired to the warden. Thus ended the check-passing expedition
            of the <a href="#vonwerner">"Count"</a> for many years. It cost the prison
            about ninety dollars for stamps and circulars and fifty dollars reward for his
            capture, besides forty-nine dollars railroad fare to bring him back, a total of
            $189.00. As there is a law upon our statutes that an officer is responsible for
            the escape of a convict, the expense of recapturing him is to be paid by this
            officer: and our chaplain, who is very conscientious will no doubt pay the
            state. Those who like music, should be willing to pay the fiddler, but it would
            perhaps be cheaper to hire an orchestra or a band than this one violinist.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>HOW TO GET OUT OF PRISON </h1>
         
         
         <p>I mean by the title of this chapter, how to get out legitimately and not by the
            <a href="#vonwerner">von Werner</a> method. This is the way: be a good
            fellow, obey the rules, attend to your own business, and before long the prison
            gates will open for you. Show the world that you are a man even though you are
            in prison. Nebraska has just adopted the indeterminate sentence and the parole
            law, and under these laws the judge shall sentence a convict prisoner (except
            those convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping and treason, whose sentence is
            affixed by the judge) to the penitentiary, but he shall not affix the duration
            of the sentence. That is left for the board of pardons and parole to do. And a
            wise and good law indeed is the indeterminate sentence law. Under the old system
            I have seen prisoners arrive at Lancaster on the same day and for the same
            crime, one with a short sentence and one with a long sentence. On the same day
            and on the same train once, but from two different counties, there came a man
            with a five year sentence for stealing a heifer and one with a two years
            sentence for stealing a team. This is how it used to be. Judge Jones gets up on
            the wrong side of the bed, and feels badly and out of sorts. He proceeds to
            court and there stands a man ready to be sentenced to the penitentiary.
            <q>"Ten years,"</q> says the judge. The poor fellow goes up for ten
            years. Now there is Judge Smith, in another county. He gets up on the right side
            of the bed, and on this morning everything looks sweet and good to him.
            <q>"One year,"</q> says he. <q>"Go down and be a man and earn two
               months good time."</q> In other words the judges, like the prisoners, and
            all the rest of us, have a temper of their own. I recall an instance where a
            prisoner stood before the judge ready to be sentenced. <q>"Four years"</q>
            says the judge. <q>"What, four years for a little thing like that?"</q>
            says the prisoner. <q>"Give him another year Mr. Clerk,"</q> says the
            judge. The prisoner again tries to argue with the judge and the judge turns to
            the clerk and adds another year. By this time the boy realizes that it does not
            pay to talk back to the judge, and he starts for Lancaster. Here he remains for
            three years, is paroled, and at this writing is doing nicely. And I have seen on
            the same day, a man come to Lancaster for one year for manslaughter, and another
            man with three years for stealing a suit of overalls and a pair of shoes. I know
            of one district where the judge possesses a heart and soul and is inclined
            toward the minimum; while another judge generally approaches the maximum
            sentence; <q>"and"</q> he adds, while chewing a big chunk of tobacco,
            <q>"I am sorry I cannot give you more!"</q> I often wonder if that
            judge ever thought of the hereafter and of the day when he himself has to stand
            before that great Judge to Whom all sinners look alike. Under this old law a
            prisoner or a bunch of prisoners were brought before the judge to be sentenced.
            He never knew them, never saw them before, perhaps he will never see them again.
            He sentences each as he sees fit, as he feels on that morning, and he knows not
            when that particular prisoner will be a fit subject to turn loose upon society
            again. Under the new law the judge sentences the prisoner to the penitentiary,
            not for a fixed term but for a term not to exceed the maximum nor less than the
            minimum term provided by law for the crime for which the prisoner was convicted.

         <p>The prisoner arrives at the penitentiary and meets the warden and the deputy
            warden. As the days go by these gentlemen learn of his character and habits, of
            his strong and his weak points, of his capacity of self control, and they make
            their reports to the board accordingly. When nine months pass by he is given an
            application blank to fill out. In this he sets forth the history of his life,
            the details of the crime, the causes leading to it and names of responsible
            parties for references. This blank then goes to the <a href="#boardofpardonsandparole"> board of pardons and parole.</a> The
            board consists of three splendid gentlemen, Hon. John O. Yeiser, of Omaha, Hon.
            Edward G. Maggi of Lincoln, and Doctor J. S. Butler of Superior. Hon. J. A.
            Piper of Lincoln is the secretary of the board. If <a href="#aldrich">Governor Aldrich</a> had searched the world over he could not have found
            four better men, nor four men better adapted for this work than these four. They
            have taken a deep interest in the welfare of the inmates and have done a world
            of good, not only for them but for society at large. As I have worked together
            with them I have come to love and admire them for their many sterling qualities
            and for their earnest and conscientious work. It is with much regret that I
            learn of Doctor Butler not being reappointed by <a href="#morehead">
               Governor Morehead,</a> but being a republican he must make room for a
            democrat. His successor is Doctor Talcott, of Crofton. This gentleman looks good
            to me, and for the boys' sake, I hope that he will turn out to be as just as his
            predecessor. I also learn, just as this book goes to press that Mr. Piper is to
            retire soon to go into business for himself. This is indeed much to be
            regretted, for Mr. Piper took great interest in his work and was well adapted
            for it. The officers and inmates all like Mr. Piper for he is possessed of the
            sunniest disposition, and sees everything from the bright side. Fortunately for
            the state as well as for the boys in gray, Mr. Yeiser and Mr. Maggi hold office
            for several years, and it will take a republican governor to remove them. Mr.
            Yeiser may, however, become a candidate for the nomination for governor, and if
            nominated, the business men, as well as the laboring men, who love him for his
            good work, will land him in the governor's chair.</p>
         
         <p>When a prisoner has been in the penitentiary for ten months, he is given a
            hearing before the board. From the warden and his deputy comes a report of the
            prisoner's behavior; from the prosecuting attorney and the judge comes another
            report as to the crime and all that they know of the prisoner; from the parole
            application comes the story as told by the prisoner himself, and from his
            references comes more information as to his past. The board is now prepared to
            deal with him and he is called to the prison library where the board meets once
            a month. It matters not to the board nor to the prisoner whether he is rich or
            poor, influential or unknown, he is treated according to the merits of his case.
            If after cross-questioning him and the answers are not satisfactory, or if some
            more information is needed, his case is continued to another meeting of the
            board; but if everything is satisfactory he is granted a parole. In no case does
            the board use undue haste but exercises much deliberation. If a parole is
            granted, a set of parole papers is drawn up which the prisoner signs. He agrees
            to remain away from saloons, pool halls, places of ill repute, to shun bad
            company and to go to church. He agrees to report to the board once a month as to
            how many days work he has done, how much earned and how much expended and how
            expended, what periodicals he has read, what articles impressed him the most,
            and what church he has attended. He must have an employer who signs an agreement
            to see that he does not keep bad company, or in other words agrees to be like an
            elder brother to him. Often when the boys are strangers in the state and without
            any friends, they have no one to sign their parole and put them to work. I have
            found employment for a score or more of these boys, and they have promised me
            upon leaving to go out and do, right. With one exception they all made good and
            are today respected citizens, an ornament to their community. Does not this
            system appeal to my reader? Is it not far better to send these men out into
            society when they are fit to enter society, than to have a judge give them a
            certain fixed sentence? Nearly all of the paroled men make good, and from
            observation I have learned that the indeterminate sentence law and the parole
            law are of immeasurable benefit not only to the men themselves in returning them
            to manhood, but to the state as well in safeguarding and protecting its
            citizens.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>NEBRASKA'S DISGRACE </h1>
         
         
         <p>In this chapter I tell my reader of a great injustice, of a disgrace to our
            state. If a man has served a sentence in prison, no matter how long, he is upon
            his discharge, given a six-dollar suit of clothes, a fifty-cent shirt, a cheap
            suit of underwear, a two-dollar pair of shoes, a dollar hat, and five dollars in
            money. It matters not how cold it is, he gets no overcoat; nor does it matter
            were he was sentenced from, five dollars is all he gets, and if that will not
            buy his ticket home he will have to walk or fly, or get there in some other way.
            From the minute he boards the car at Lancaster he is known by his clothes as a
            discharged convict. Police officers keep their eyes upon him. When in prison
            everything was furnished, but now he has to look out for something to eat and a
            place to sleep. Before long his five dollars are gone. What will he do then? Is
            he much to blame if he, unable to get work, commits another crime? Is not the
            state, in an indirect way, a party to the crime? Two years ago the legislature
            passed a law to give the outgoing prisoner ten dollars, but unfortunately they
            overlooked to appropriate funds for that purpose, thus the law was of no value.'
            It reminds me of a friend of mine, who was quite a hunter. He invited me up to
            his house to take dinner with him. He had shot a young, wild goose' and his good
            wife was preparing it for us. Long before we came to the house we smelled the
            goose cooking. While his wife was not looking, his neighbor's dog got the goose,
            much to our disappointment. Well, we managed to get along anyhow. It is the same
            way with the, boys of Lancaster. They had heard so much of the ten dollar bill
            they were to get and they saw the law enacted; but they never got the ten, they
            got only the smell of it, and they, too, had to get along somehow with the five
            only. And again at the 1913 session of the legislature, it went the same way. I
            made several trips to the state house and conferred with several senators. Some
            of them were surprised over existing conditions. Only one knew all about it;
            that was Senator Dodge of Omaha. The senators promised that they would do all in
            their power in this matter and they kept their promise; but someway, somehow,
            the bill went astray in the house, and again no appropriation. One good thing,
            however, about those sterling patriots who serve in our legislatures-they never
            forget to appropriate funds for their own salaries. That is usually the first
            number on the program, and not only is it the first, but is passed with an
            emergency clause, that those good solons will not have to wait for their
            hard-earned money. I will ask my reader, "What is the best for the state, as
            well as the cheapest in the long run-to give the outgoing boys five dollars
            and the cheap clothes, and then have many of them come back again as a ward
            of the state; or give them a decent suit of clothes, a ticket to their home,
            and ten dollars in cash?" Believe me, the latter is the cheapest to the
            tax payers in the long run. Now all of this refers to the discharged convict
            only, not to those paroled, for they get-nothing at all. Sometimes his employer
            brings him clothes, sometimes the prison officials or his friends get clothes
            for him; and sometimes the suit of an incoming prisoner is given to him;
            sometimes he is turned out into the world in his convict garb. That is what I
            call Nebraska's disgrace. Think of it my reader - to turn a man out in the gray
            prison suits worn at Lancaster! Certainly steps ought to be taken to prevent
            this. All the friends of the boys in gray should come to the state house and do
            all they can to have such a law enacted, and see that funds are appropriated for
            this purpose. To properly equip the outgoing prisoners, I refer to the
            legislative recommendation of <a href="#melick">Warden Melick</a> - to
            furnish them with ten dollars in money, a ticket to where they were sent from or
            any other place of equal distance, an overcoat during the fall and winter
            months, and decent clothes such as will not advertise him to all citizens of
            Lincoln and to every officer throughout the state.</p>

            smallest roaches are about one-quarter of an inch and the largest are over two
            inches long. Believe me, the large ones are <q>"some animals."</q>
            If those big fellows could only be trained for some good purpose or used as
            runners. Unlike the bedbug, the roach never bites, or in anyway injures human
            beings, but is always on the lookout for something good to eat. As there are
            delicacies in nearly every cell, likewise there are roaches in every cell. It
            matters not if the eatables are wrapped in paper or cardboard, the roach will

            the ugliest things on earth. His body is covered with slime, and the scientists
            accuse him of carrying tubercular germs from place to place. Like the bedbug, he
            is a very unwelcome visitor; and an everlasting campaign of extermination must
            be kept up or they will increase and carry off the prison. Then there is the
            centipede, also called the thousand-leg or the water bug. He is a dark gray
            color, is well supplied with legs, is fond of damp places and usually makes his
            home in cracks in the stone walls. While I have never known of him to bite or
            injure a human being, yet it is unpleasant to have him take his daily exercise
            over your body as you lie in bed. And he certainly can run; I believe that he
            can beat a race horse running.</p>

         <p>The centipedes, however, are not nearly as plentiful as the bedbugs and roaches.
            Then there is the little ant. Your wife may divorce you, and your best girl go
            back on you, while you lie in prison at Lancaster, but your ant &#x2014; never. I
            should have said ants for there are many of all sizes and colors. There is the
            little red one, the large brown one, and still a very large black one. If you
            have sugar and sweet things in your cell, the ants will camp there forever.
            These latter, however, disappear during the cold months, while the other three
            are with you all the time. Like the imps of hades, so are these uninvited guests
            at Lancaster - one everlasting pest and scource of misery and pain. </p>

         <h1> CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>PETS IN THE PEN </h1>
         
         
         <p>The big prison has its pets as well as its pests. Men in prison, finding
            themselves cut away from their parents, wives or children, look in there for
            some pet on which to lavish their affection.' Canary birds are very popular,
            especially among the life timers, but somehow the change in temperature of the
            cell building did not agree with the birds and they are all dead and gone. One
            life-timer raised many of these little sweet singers, and they were all the
            world to him. Shame on a certain prison official who, when his office expired
            and before leaving Lincoln, went to the life-timer and took his birds. <q>"I
               will send you a check soon,"</q> he said to the life-timer. Several years
            have passed and the check has not come yet, and it never will. I have known some
            mean men. We once had a fellow serving a year for entering a dwelling house and
            stealing seven cents out of a baby's little bank as well as drinking the milk
            out of her bottle. I have always thought that this was the meanest man in the
            world, but I came to think later that a prison official who earns a good salary
            and yet will go and take a life-timer's pets away from him, is as mean a man as
            ever was put into the world, </p>
         
         <p> Another pet was "Joe." He was a large blacksnake with headquarters in the
            wall of the engine house. A fireman serving a long time for forgery made Joe his
            special pet. When our friend whistled, Joe came out from his hole and the two
            took luncheon together. One evening Joe disappeared. Perhaps he was looking for
            religion, for he wandered into the chapel; from there into the office of <a href="#morse"> Chief Turnkey Frank Morse.</a> This gentleman was making
            his daily report when Joe came in, and soon he got a stick and dispatched Joe to
            another world. The fireman, grief stricken over the loss of his pet, did not
            sleep that night, nor sleep the next</p>

         <p>day. Joe was buried in the corner of the prison yard. Then there was little
            "Tessie," a fox terrier dog that for years was a pet of the boys
            until a swift kick by a mule sent her straight to the dog heaven. But by far the
            most popular of all pets was "Bob", a dog belonging to <a href="#melick"> Warden S Melick.</a> Not only was "Bob" an all
            around pet, but the mascot of the band as well. "Big Bill" is a pet and a
            curiosity besides. He is perhaps the largest goldfish in the state and has been
            in the greenhouse for over twelve years. I learn with regret as this book goes
            to press that poor old "Bill" and also his wife, have passed away, and
            the manager of the greenhouse is downhearted over the loss of his two
            friends.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
         
         <h1>MURDER WITHIN HIS HEART </h1>
         
         
         <p>On the sixth day of December, 1909, we received a yellow negro by the name of
            <a href="#prince"> Albert Prince.</a> He came from Omaha to serve
            twelve and a half years for the attempted murder of an Omaha detective. <a href="#prince"> Prince,</a> a stranger in Omaha, was hanging around a
            saloon at Fourteenth and Davenport Streets. When the detective went to question
            him he turned and without any provocation fired four shots into the body of the
            detective. Although seriously wounded, he afterwards recovered. <a href="#prince"> Prince</a> was arrested, tried and sent to Lancaster
            where he was registered as number 5374. He no doubt came to Omaha from Kansas
            City where two yellow negros had committed a lot of highway robberies. A
            policeman met <a href="#prince"> Prince</a> and his pal and ordered them
            to hold up their hands. The pal obeyed orders but <a href="#prince">
               Prince</a> did not; instead he pulled out a gun and aimed at the officer's
            heart, but the gun refused to work. With the gun still pointed at the officer he
            backed away into an alley, disappeared in the darkness and was never seen in
            Kansas City afterward. But from information furnished by his pal, the officers
            got a very good description of him and circulars were mailed broadcast. The
            Omaha detective recognized him from one of these circulars and was ready to
            arrest him when the negro shot him. We afterwards learned that his home was in
            Cincinnati where his mother lives. He left home when a mere boy, drifted through
            the western states, made a trip into Mexico and Central America, and visited the
            Island of <a href="#haiti"><i>Hayti (sic) </i>.</a> Never did
            he earn a dollar by honest work, always was he committing crimes, always was
            there murder within his heart. For a while he made a very good prisoner at
            Lancaster, and soon became the head barber. In this capacity he goes from shop
            to shop and shaves the men. While he ingratiated him self with the officers, he
            at the same time became hated by most of the men. He charged a fee per month for
            giving good shaves, and woe unto the poor fellow who had no money to tip him. He
            literally tore the whiskers from his face, and also used towels upon their faces
            which he had previously used upon the face of a negro. The head barber is a
            privileged character at Lancaster, is not locked up at the same time as the
            other prisoners, but spends his evenings in the cell house corridors. During the
            fall of 1911, <a href="#prince"> Prince</a> entered into a plot to
            liberate <a href="#johnson">Thomas Johnson,</a> a negro murderer under
            sentence to be hung. His intention was to kill the night cell keeper or any
            prison official that crossed his path, to open <a href="#johnson">Johnson's</a> cell, scale the wall and depart. His plans miscarried, a
            confederate went to <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> and told of the
            plot, a search was made, and a long double edged knife and a piece of gas pipe
            were found concealed beneath the barber chair. <a href="#prince">
               Prince</a> was then removed from his position as a trusty and placed in
            the hole. Even there he was unruly and troublesome. It became necessary to give
            him the water cure, which means to turn the hose on him. It did not take long
            for the cold water to quiet him, and for several days he was good. While I am no
            particular admirer of <a href="#smith">Warden Smith,</a> yet I wish to
            inform my reader that there was no other way at the time to subdue the negro
            than either to kill him or to apply the water. <a href="#smith">Mr.
               Smith</a> chose the latter. While speaking of the water cure, I wish to
            say that the water has never been turned upon a prisoner since that day. In his
            article in <cite>"Nebraska State Journal"</cite> of March 19, 1912, Judge Frost
            says: <q>"Michigan has a law against showering with water, a practice still
               common in Nebraska."</q> From a talk I have had with the judge I am
            conviced his intentions are good but that he was misinformed. <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> never found it necessary to use it again,
            and his successors, <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty,</a>
            <a href="#melick">Warden Melick</a> and <a href="#fenton">Warden
               Fenton</a> have never used it. It is a thing of the past, discarded
            forever. <a href="#prince"> Prince</a> remained several weeks in the hole
            and was then taken out and dressed in a striped suit and a ball and chain
            fastened onto him. He was put to work in the broom factory where he was an
            everlasting source of trouble. He grew more and more sulky as the days went by.
            One day while carrying a lot of broomstraw through the factory another prisoner
            happened to stumble against him and the broomstraw fell upon the floor. He
            became furious and told the man that if he ever did that again he would kill
            him; and no doubt, had he had a knife right then and there he would have stabbed
            the other man to death.</p>
         
         <p>About this time the prison administration changed, <a href="#smith"> Warden
               Smith</a> retired and <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a> and
            <a href="#davis">Deputy Warden Davis</a> took office. One of the first
            official acts of <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was to send for <a href="#prince"> Prince.</a> The negro came to his office. <q>"Don't
               you think that you have worn this thing long enough, my boy?"</q> said
            the deputy warden. <q>"Yes,"</q> was the negro's laconic reply.
            <q>"Well, I will take it off right now, and here is a pass to the
               clothing department. You go over and pull off these stripes and get a new
               suit. Get to look like a man, and act like one."</q> This shows the
            kindness of <a href="#david">Mr. David.</a> Nearly every prisoner would
            have appreciated a favor of that kind immediately; but did <a href="#prince"> Prince?</a> No, he became more and more sulky, and there was murder in
            his heart. He wanted to get even with the world-with someone, be did not know
            with whom, but he did know that he must kill somebody. His next move was to
            start a mutiny in the shop. He suggested that some of the other prisoners take
            sledge hammers and go from place to place in the shop and break up the
            machinery, <q>"And while you are doing that I will go upon the guard stand
               and I will not only kill the but will cut his head plumb off."</q> The
            other boys refused to join him. He had however, one friend, the prison chaplain,
            <a href="#johnson"> Mr. Johnson.</a> The two would visit every Sunday
            afternoon, and I presume they talked religion. However all this religion seemed
            to work the wrong way, for instead of repenting, <a href="#prince">
               Prince</a> became more and more bloodthirsty. He must commit a murder. He
            put in his spare time in the shop making a piece of steel into a double edged
            knife, and he made it as sharp as a razor. He carved a wooden handle and
            fastened the blade onto it with broom wire: It was now a regular stiletto and a
            weapon well fit to use for assassination.</p>
         
         <p>On the following Sunday <a href="#smith">Warden Smith</a> visited Lancaster
            and attended church. <a href="#prince"> Prince</a> afterwards stated that
            he was sorry that he did not have the knife with him, and <q>"I would have
               put Tom Smith on the bum."</q> So the next day he brought the stiletto to
            his cell and concealed it there. He decided that the deputy warden was to be the
            next victim.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
         
         <h1>THE DEPUTY WARDEN </h1>
         
         
         <p>
            <a href="#davis">Edward D. Davis</a> was born in the northern part of
            Wales, November 16, 1846, and came with his parents to Johnstown, Pennsylvania
            at an early age. Here he grew to manhood, receiving a common school education.
            In 1863 he enlisted in the hundred-day service, and in 1864 re-enlisted in the
            Eighty-third Pennsylvania volunteer infantry, and served to the close of the
            war. He was married May 10, 1871 to Miss Elizabeth Rees, also a native of Wales.
            His father died in 1883, and his mother in 1889, a victim of the Johnstown
            flood. In 1878 Mr. and Mrs. <a href="#davis">Davis</a> came to Clay
            County, locating at Glenville, where he followed blacksmithing until elected
            sheriff in 1887. He held the office of sheriff for four terms and was a popular
            and efficient officer. He was a man of splendid physical power and courage. He
            was accustomed to deal with criminals and was fearless in the discharge of his
            duties. After retiring from the sheriff's office he and Mrs. Davis traveled a
            great deal. He practically retired from active life except one term as warden of
            the penitentiary. He retained business interests in Clay Center, being
            stockholder in the Commercial State Bank of which he was at one time the
            vice-president. He was a member of the Masons, Odd Fellows and A. O. U. W. At
            Lancaster, <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was well liked by officers and
            inmates. He believed in strict discipline, firm rules and kind treatment. He and
            I had many mutual friends working in the mines in Colorado where I formerly
            operated some mines. He used to drop into the office every night, and we would
            discuss mining and talk about our Johnstown friends. About eight o'clock he
            would pull out his watch and say, <q>"It is time for me climb the golden
               stairs."</q> Then he would go upstairs to his apartments.</p>
         
         <p>
            <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was a great lover of nature, of flowers and
            of all that was beautiful in life. Especially was he fond of a little rose tree
            that grew on the lawn in front of the east cell building. I remember one fall
            day when he and I were taking a little walk in front of the prison, how he
            turned towards the beds of flowers and said to me: <q>"Well the flowers are
               fast fading away and the little humming birds too are leaving us. I wonder
               if we will live to see them next year."</q> I said, <q>"Let us hope
               so, Warden."</q> For quite a while he did not say anything but we walked
            in silence. Of what he was thinking I have wondered, and did he have a
            presentiment of coming evil? I am certain that he did, for often he used to talk
            with me about the underhanded work done the little band of would-be reformers.
            Since that time, when I look upon the roses at Lancaster, and see the humming
            birds, my thoughts wander back to that evening and to my departed friend.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
         
         <h1>THE ASSASSINATION </h1>
         
         
         <p><q>Did you notice that the deputy warden does not wear a flower this
               morning?"</q> said Frank, the head janitor of the prison to me, on the
            morning of Sunday, the eleventh of February, 1912. <q>"It looks strange for
               it is the first Sunday morning that I have ever seen him without a flower of
               some sort. I went to the greenhouse and brought in this tuberose. Will you
               be so kind as to take it upstairs to him?</q> I took the tuberose, went
            up to <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis'</a> apartments, and asked him why he did
            not wear a flower this morning as usual. He was in fine spirits and replied:
            <q>"Well, you see these ladies are forgetting me."</q>
            <q>"Take a look at him and see whether we are forgetting him or not,"</q>
            said Mrs. Davis. <q>"Look at his new suit and the new tie I got him."</q>
            The deputy warden was well dressed at all times, and this morning he looked
            especially nice in a new light gray suit with a dark blue tie. As I put the
            tuberose in his buttonhole he said, <q>"Please thank Frank for the
               flower."</q> We chatted for a little while, then came the signal to go to
            church. <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> went into the chapel and I went
            back to the office. Little did I think at that moment, that before midnight, our
            beloved <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> would lie cold in death.</p>
         
         <p>The church services passed by as usual. The men had just finished singing the
            hymn <cite>"Stand Up For Jesus,"</cite> the notes of the song had hardly died
            away, and the men were still standing awaiting the benediction. <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis,</a> as was his usual custom at the close of
            services, walked across the aisle to unlock the south door through which the
            prisoners pass into the yard and from thence into their cells. All of a sudden
            the negro <a href="#prince">Prince,</a> sneaked up behind him and quickly
            thrust his dagger into the abdomen of the deputy. Taken by surprise, <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> stepped to one side, throwing forward his
            hand in defense. <a href="#prince">Prince</a> followed and quickly dealt
            him four more blows. <a href="#wagner">Mr. Wagner,</a> then a guard,
            grabbed <a href="#prince">Prince</a> by the arm. The negro turned around
            and handed the dagger to <a href="#wagner">Mr, Wagner.</a> The negro was
            told to go to the hole, which he did. <a href="#wagner">Mr. Wagner</a>
            sent me word to telephone to Doctor Stradling and to Doctor Wilmeth. The whole
            incident was in absolute silence. Never once did <a href="#davis">Mr.
               Davis</a> cry out, although he was stabbed thrice in the abdomen, once
            below the heart, once in the left side of the face, and once on the hand while
            using it to guard against the blows. The men also kept quiet, not a single voice
            was raised, nor was there any confusion of any kind. <a href="#davis">Mr.
               Davis</a> walked into his office, and meeting <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a> said: <q>"I am going to leave you Jim,"</q>
            for he realized that he was mortally wounded. Leaning upon the strong arm of Mr.
            Dinsmore, <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> walked to the hospital and sat
            down in the operating chair. I wish to pause here and tell my reader about Mr.
            Dinsmore, or the <q>"Convict Physician,"</q> as Judge Frost calls
            him. He is a tall, fine appearing man, refined and to all appearances, a
            gentleman. Thirteen years behind the walls of Lancaster have turned his hair and
            mustache prematurely gray. He is a well preserved man and walks with a military
            bearing. He may have his faults, and who has not, but within him beats a heart
            full of sympathy and mercy. He is serving a life sentence. It is true that he is
            charged with murder, and it is also true that he at times has violated the
            prison rules, but nevertheless he is entitled to justice. He has been true and
            sincere and never professed to be converted, for he is no hypocrite. This "is
            perhaps one reason why he has incurred the wrath of those blatherskites in
            skirts who pose as soul savers." He also incurred the everlasting hatred
            of several of the convicts because he would not supply them with
            <q>"dope."</q> It was one or two of these latter, on vengeance
            bent, who told Judge Frost the lies that furnished the basis for the following

            <h1>"A CONVICT PHYSICIAN"</h1>
            
            
            <p>
               <q>"I have already said considerable about Convict <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a>. For years except for one or two
                  times when he was removed for some dereliction, he has been the hospital
                  steward. As such he has handled perhaps nine&#x2014;tenths of the
                  medicine administered to the convicts. Many a convict has been afraid to
                  take medicine administered to him. When it is recalled that he killed
                  his wife by using a poison compounded by himself, one cannot wonder. I
                  have had instances narrated to me where this man or that man claimed to
                  have had poison administered to him by Dinsmore. I have even been told
                  of instances where a certain convict was actually poisoned to deaths One
                  ex&#x2014;convict has told me of how he himself has been nearly poisoned
                  by a green pill given him by this convict as the state's agent. Whether
                  there is any truth in these stories or not AUTHOR'S
                  NOTE:There is not the slightest truth in these stories. it is
                  certain that no man who is <q>'doing it all'</q> should be
                  administering medicine to his fellow convicts. This man Dinsmore was not
                  licensed to practice medicine. I have a letter from the state board to
                  that effect. I am also assured by the same authority that he is not a
                  licensed druggist. Notwithstanding these facts we have had this
                  spectacle of the state of Nebraska allowing this man to practice
                  medicine upon our helpless convicts. If Dinsmore had done this on the
                  outside of the penitentiary walls he would have been subject to criminal
                  prosecution."</q>
               </p>
            
            <p>Since meeting with Judge Frost I have come to the conclusion that he is a
               sincere and honest man, who is doing all this for the public welfare, but
               those who have told him the above have willfully and maliciously lied to
               him. One of these men is well known to me, and I will tell my reader a
               little about him. He was sent to Lancaster for life, and easily won the good
               will of <a href="#delahunty">Deputy Warden Delahunty.</a> At his own
               expense <a href="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</a> traveled to the extreme
               western part of the state and interceded for him with the judge and the
               prosecuting attorney. From these gentlemen, <a href="#delahunty">Mr.
                  Delahunty</a> got letters to the governor recommending that the
               sentence be commuted from life to ten years, which means, with good time
               allowance deducted, only seven years and one month. Were you, my reader,
               serving a life sentence at Lancaster, and a man had your sentence reduced to
               ten years, would you not consider him your best friend? Would you not pray
               for him every night for the rest of your life? I know I would. But did he
               show his appreciation? No, his soul was saved by the old women soulsavers,
               and to them he furnished much information which they peddled around and
               magnified, and which led up to the tragedy at Lancaster. I recall how this
               man posed as a reformed sinner and was at the head of his Bible class. Also
               do I remember the Sunday morning after <a href="#davis">Warden
                  Davis</a> was assassinated. This man was discharged from the prison
               and an officer asked him where he was going, His answer was: <q>"All that
                  I know at the present is that I am going down to take luncheon with Mrs.
                  So&#x2014;and&#x2014;so, (one of the soulsavers). I may stay in Lincoln
                  for some time, and I may leave right away; I don't know, but I do know
                  that tonight I am going out to pick up a <q>'lady
                     friend'</q>."</q> This sincere gentleman afterwards became
               an evangelist, a <q>"brother,"</q> with headquarters at the
               mission, the same religious joint of which I have already informed my
               reader, the one of grass&#x2014;widow fame. And that is a nice and easy life,
               with no hard work whatever, only to dish out a generous supply of hot air.
               This he does without much effort. It is indeed interesting to see some of
               these evangelists standing upon the street corner with down&#x2014;cast eyes,
               praying for us poor sinners, and at the same time watching the slit skirts
               of the ladies passing by out of one little corner of their eye. From such a
               source comes the prison story above, and the same is published by Judge
               Frost in good faith. But a man who is serving a life sentence behind the
               bars, and who has spent thirteen of his best years at Lancaster, has
               troubles enough of his own without outsiders making up more for him. It is a
               great injustice to him to publish such rot without thoroughly investigating
               whether it is true or not. "They say,"
               "so&#x2014;and&#x2014;so." You often hear those two words, "they
               say," And who are <q>"they"?</q> God only knows. The
               scandalmongers use these two words, "they say," from early until
               late. Little does it matter to them that a man's reputation, a woman's
               honor, is ruined by their "they say," Today "they say," that
               Jones is intoxicated; tomorrow "they say," that Jones is a drunkard;
               and day after tomorrow "they say," that Jones never drew a sober
               breath. And thus lies and scandal travel down the line. Soon a person's
               character and reputation are ruined by "they say,"; but what do they
               care? I am no particular friend of Mr. Dinsmore, but I like to see him get
               the square deal. Now that so much bad has been said and written about him by
               this gang, I am here today to give him justice and set forth some of his
               many good deeds, one certain one of which will offset all his misdeeds and
               land him in heaven. Judge Frost has said and written much about this man.
               When I asked the judge the other day if he had ever called upon <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a> for information, he said that
               he had not, and that he did not even know the warden. I happened to think of
               what <a href="#melick">Warden Melick</a> used to say, <q>"There are
                  always two sides to a story";</q> and before reprimanding an inmate
               he always heard both the story of the guard and the inmate. Had Judge Frost
               done likewise and not depended upon the stories of a few discharged inmates
               bent on revenge, but had gone to the warden and heard his side of the story,
               the above article would perhaps never have been written. If the judge
               likewise would have called upon the convict physician and heard his side of
               the story and thoroughly investigated his work, I am certain that he would
               have written quite a different article.</p>
            
            <p>Soon after <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was placed in the operating
               chair, along came the negro brute, <a href="#prince">Prince,</a> also
               headed for the hospital. As he passed the operating room on his way to the
               hole, he saw the deputy warden lying bleeding in the chair. Shouting
               <q>"I want to finish him"</q> he sprang towards him, but here is
               where he reckoned with brave Frank Dinsmore, for while he was attending <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> with one hand, he succeeded in keeping
               the negro at bay with the other hand until a guard arrived and locked the
               assassin in a cell. Even after being locked up he kept on shouting <q>"I
                  wish that I had finished him"</q> and <q>"You finish him,
                  Doc."</q> Mr. Dinsmore worked hard and faithfully to save the deputy
               warden's life, but alas, he kept growing weaker and weaker. Soon Doctor <a href="#spradling">Spradling</a> and Doctor <a href="#wilmeth">Wilmeth</a> arrived, but despite the efforts of the doctors he grew
               worse and worse and an operation was found necessary. This was performed at
               noon, but he never came out from under the influence of the <i>anesthesia (sic) </i> and passed away at midnight. He
               has climbed the golden stairs; he has joined the angels above; he is sitting
               close to the throne.</p>
            
            <p><a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was well liked by the convicts and many
               were shedding tears in their cells. From time to time they sent inquiries to
               the office about his condition. The officers and guards did not go to bed
               but remained in the hall awaiting the outcome. None of us ate anything: we
               were too grieved to eat. At midnight <a href="#delahunty">Warden
                  Delahunty</a> came down stairs. The guards waiting in the hail asked
               no questions, they could tell by the looks on the <a href="#delahunty">warden's</a> face what had happened. The <a href="#delahunty">warden</a> went into the office and sat down; neither of us spoke a
               word; both of us cried bitterly for we felt the loss keenly. There was grief
               and sorrow everywhere-except with one man, the man whose particular duty it
               was to console the grief-stricken - the chaplain of the prison. His room was
               on the third floor above those of <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis,</a> and
               at midnight he was awakened by the cries of the heartbroken widow on the
               floor below. He arose, put on his trousers and his vest, but not his coat,
               and with an impatient look upon his face he wandered up and down the hail.
               What did it matter to him that a good woman had lost her husband? what did
               it matter to him that a woman's heart was breaking? &#x2014; for was he not
               losing his sleep?</p>
            
            <p>How lonesome were my evenings after this day without the company of <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis!</a> The place seemed so strange and empty
               to me! How they all missed <a href="#davis">Mr. and Mrs. Davis;</a>
               for they had done a world of good and scattered sunshine wherever they went.
               One of my choicest possessions is a tie given me by <a href="#davis">Mr.
                  Davis</a> for Christmas. I wear it only once a year, on the eleventh
               day of February, in memory of the good man who gave it to me.</p>
            
            <p><a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was buried in Wyuka cemetery. Upon his
               grave grows the little rose tree that be loved so much in life, transferred
               from the lawn at Lancaster, a tribute from <a href="#mellick">Warden
                  Melick</a> to the memory of his departed friend.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
         
         <h1>THE "CONVICT PHYSICIAN" </h1>
         
         
         
         <p>I wish to tell my reader a little more about the "Convict Physician."
            Thirteen years ago <a href="#dinsmore">Mr. Dinsmore</a> came to the prison
            and was put to work in the prison broom shop. Men at the prison are assigned to
            what position they are best adapted to fill, and it did not take long for the
            officials to find out that he was too valuable a man to make brooms. If a
            convict is a bookkeeper on the outside and a bookkeeper is needed, he stands a
            far better show to get a position as bookkeeper than does one who follows the
            trade of <em>stove moulder (sic)</em>; likewise, is a <em>stove moulder
               (sic)</em> needed the chances are that the warden would not draw him from
            the ranks of those keeping books for a living. At no time is a prisoner assigned
            to a certain position in order to satisfy the wishes of a gang of gossipers.</p>
         
         
         <p>When a hospital steward was needed, the choice of the administration fell upon
            <a href="#dinsmore">Mr. Dinsmore</a>, he being the best educated man
            behind the walls. Judge <a href="#frost">Frost</a> in his article says
            that he has a letter from the state board of health stating that <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a> has no license to practice medicine and is
            not even a registered pharmacist, all of which is true. Likewise it is correct
            that if he went to <em>practise (sic)</em> medicine on the outside that he
            would be arrested. Although without a license he is far better qualified to
            <em>practise (sic)</em> medicine than many a quack in Lincoln or
            throughout the country who managed to to squeeze through college, or who in some
            mysterious way obtained a diploma. The fact of the matter is that for years the
            great state has not paid the prison doctor a salary befitting a fourth-class
            horse doctor, nevertheless once in a while the prison has had a most efficient
            physician. The salary paid was only seventy-five dollars per month; and no
            doctor, who is a doctor, can afford to give his entire time to the prison for
            that little amount. He used to come to the prison for two hours every other day
            only; in other words, he put in six or seven hours each week. Since then the
            doctor's salary has been increased to one hundred dollars per month, and he now
            stays at the prison from eight o'clock in the morning until four in the
            afternoon. Even this arrangement is not as it ought to be. The state should have
            a first-class physician, should pay him a decent salary and furnish him with
            apartments at the prison so that he could be there day and night. Never does a
            week pass by at the prison but what somebody is injured or wounded in the
            factories. At the time of the shirt factory boys would often willfully injure
            their fingers that they may be excused for a day or two from that inferno.
            Considering that there are about four hundred inhabitants to look after, my
            reader can imagine that the hospital steward, who acts as doctor in the absence
            of the real doctor, is kept busy; and from his thirteen years experience, Mr.
            <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a> has become an expert in the bandaging
            of wounds and in caring for the sick. I will leave it to Judge <a href="#frost">Frost</a> and my readers to decide which is the best,
            either to let a wounded man bleed to death, or perhaps have blood poison set in
            while awaiting the arrival of a licensed practitioner, or have this "Convict
            Physician," as the judge calls him, attend to him, stop the flow of
            blood immediately and save the finger, the arm, or perhaps the life of the
            injured person. Especially, when this man, after his thirteen years of
            experience can do it as well as a young doctor just out of college, and much
            better than many practicing physicians who in all their practice have not tied
            up as many wounds as has this man in a few months. I have in my pocket a
            memorandum book; I notice that a page is given to <cite>"First
               Aid to the Injured."</cite> I also see in the almanac upon my desk another
            page entitled <cite>"Help in Case of accidents."</cite> The
            saving of a human life is quite important, and where a life is at stake I think
            that all prejudice, all <em>gossipping (sic)</em> and red tape should be
            dispensed with. At no place in the <cite>Bible</cite> do I find
            where <a href="#jesus">Jesus</a> had a license to practice medicine, yet
            he healed the masses and instructed his disciples to heal all kinds of sickness
            and disease. Neither do I read of any record of that <a href="#goodsamaritan">good Samaritan</a> being licensed, who came along
            and saved the life of the man lying in the public road. In making these
            statements I do not condemn the practice of medicine but refer to emergencies
            only. And like the <a href="#goodsamaritan">good Samaritan</a>, this
            convict physician has for years healed the wounded and administered to the sick
            regardless of whether they were rich or poor, black or white. He has done this
            at all hours and without a penny's remuneration. He worked hard and faithfully
            to save the lives of those prison officials who fell at their post of duty,
            victims of assassins, and many lives have been saved and hundreds of dollars
            have been saved the state. Had the would-be reformers seen the work that this
            man has done they would perhaps instead of making his life miserable, appeal to
            the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> for mercy and clemency for him. May
            the day soon come when some executive will see things in their right light and
            grant the "Convict Physician" a pardon. </p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
         
         <h1>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT </h1>
         
         
         <p>Following the attack upon the <a href="#davis">deputy warden</a>, <a href="#prince">Prince</a> was placed in the hole but not strung up; the
            following day a cot was given him. When it became known that <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> had passed away there was much unrest among
            the guards, some of whom wanted to lynch the <i>negro (sic) </i>; however, common
            sense prevailed and about one o'clock they went to bed. As a precautionary
            measure <a href="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</a> had previously taken the
            keys from the turnkey and <i>secreted (sic) </i> them. I doubt if the
            <i>negro (sic) </i> ever knew how near he came to being lynched that night.
            After being placed in the hole he became quite talkative. To Deputy County
            Attorney <a href="#hager">Hager</a> he confessed that he had planned the
            murder on that same Sunday morning. When asked by Mr. <a href="#hager">Hager</a> if he had a desire to avenge some wrong committed against him
            by Mr. <a href="#davis">Davis</a>, he said that he did not have anything
            against Mr. <a href="#davis">Davis</a> in particular but that he had it in
            for <a href="#smith">Tom Smith</a> and his deputy, <a href="#welton">Jim Welton</a>, and would like to have "gotten" them. He said that
            <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> reprimanded him once for taking a fork
            to his cell but that he was not sore against him for that. It was the prison,
            the prison rules and prison managers that he was against and not any individual.
            Like the anarchists who kill kings, it was the same way with <a href="#prince">Prince</a>. They seem not to realize that just as soon as
            their victim is dead there is another person to take his place. He expressed no
            signs of regret; on the contrary he said that <i>be (sic) </i> was sorry that he
            did not complete the murder.</p>
         
         
         <p>I recall how the little army of soulsavers left the chapel on the noon after Mr.
            <a href="#davis">Davis</a> was assassinated. Not one of them stopped
            at the office to inquire as to the condition of the deputy. Standing in the
            office the warden. and I saw them pass out and go across the road. They were in
            high spirits and laughing as if they had just left a vaudeville show. <q>"A
               sympathetic lot of Christians,"</q> I said to <a href="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</a>. The warden did not answer, his eyes were full of
            tears. I thought of what would have happened had circumstances been reversed and
            Mr. <a href="#davis">Davis</a> had seen the <i>negro (sic) </i> in time and
            felled him to the floor. There would not have been any laughter then, but the
            news would soon have been scattered broadcast of the shameful treatment of a
            poor inmate in the house of the Lord, and the innocent public would have
            believed it. Did any of these soulsavers call and comfort the widow in her great
            sorrow? No, indeed, but several of them phoned out afterward and asked
            <q>"How is dear <a href="#prince">Mr. Prince</a> getting
               along?"</q></p>
         
         
         <p>For several days he was gloomy and had but little to say. He spent most of his
            time fixing up his cell and making himself as comfortable as possible. A wire
            was ex-tended up into his cell and furnished him with light. A shoe box served
            as writing desk and parlor table combined. Crowds of curiosity seekers flocked
            to the prison that afternoon and for several days thereafter. They wanted to see
            the murderer; and strange to say there came ten women to one man. They were
            politely told <q>"nothing doing,"</q> and were much disappointed for they
            would have liked <q>"so much to see the poor boy."</q> To Reverend Doctor
            <a href="#may">May</a>, his spiritual adviser, and to Messrs <a href="#howard1">Howard</a> and <a href="#howard2">Howard</a>, his
            attorneys, the doors were open at any time.</p>
         
         
         <p>He was given a preliminary examination, where he pleaded not guilty. His trial
            was set for June the sixth. On his second day in the hole he wrote a letter to
            his <a href="#msprince">mother</a> in Ohio and told her not to worry, that
            he would be all right. He also wrote a letter to his <a href="princebrother">stepbrother</a> in <a href="#newyork">New York</a> and asked him to
            come to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. He wrote to several religious
            people, and received several cards and religious papers from unknown sources.
            Also a card came with a skull and crossbones. It read <q>"Give <a href="#satan">Satan</a> my best regards, and I will send you down a
               chunk of ice."</q> This card we never delivered to him as it is the
            policy at the prison not to deliver any mail to any inmate that has a tendency
            to hurt his feelings or to cause him to worry. A box of candy also came. There
            was no name of the sender upon the box. As it had a peculiar odor we thought
            that it perhaps contained poison, so it was consigned to the bottom of the lake.
            Well did we know that if the candy was poisoned and the <i>negro (sic) </i> died
            from eating it, that our friends, the soulsavers, would raise the cry
            <q>"They have poisoned the poor boy."</q>
            <a href="#prince">Prince</a> had about twelve dollars to his credit in the
            prison bank at the time of the murder. He now invested in horse hair, from which
            he made watch fobs that were sold at the prison cigar stand. In this way he made
            several dollars. When he was not making watch fobs he was writing poetry which
            he sent to his correspondents. Off and on he also sent small sums of money to a
            former prison official who had <q>"resigned"</q> and who lived in
            <a href="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>. Soon his <a href="#princebrother">stepbrother</a> arrived and found work in a hotel.
            He looked more like a twin brother to the murderer than a stepbrother. They were
            permitted to visit each other, but a guard stood by and heard their
            conversation. The brother usually brought a bag of fruit. This was always given
            a most careful examination. After <a href="#prince">Prince</a> had been in
            the hole for a few days he sent for and was given a <cite>Bible</cite> and became a most ardent <cite>Bible</cite>
            student. What a pity that he did not commence long ago!</p>
         
         
         <p>At his trial, held in June, his attorneys fought hard to save his life from the
            gallows but the odds were against them. He was found guilty and Judge <a href="#cornish">Cornish</a> sentenced him to hang on August the
            thirteenth. Mr. <a href="#howard1">Howard</a> immediately appealed to the
            <i>su-preme (sic) </i> court. It was during his trial that <a href="#prince">Prince</a>, upon seeing Mrs. <a href="#msdavis">Davis</a> enter the court room, turned to Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> and said: <q>"If I had stopped to think of the grief and
               sorrow that my crime would cause that woman, I would never have done it. As
               I look upon her and see how she suffers I feel sorry for what I did."</q>
            This was the only time that he ever expressed any regret over his crime. When
            going to and from the courthouse he had walked erect, with an air of bravado,
            and seemed to enjoy the notoriety that he was getting. He had expected a life
            sentence, and now he was much disappointed, became sullen and gloomy, and seemed
            to realize that he was up against it. He studied the <cite>Bible</cite> more and more, and wrote many letters to religious people,
            also to the former <a href="#tecumeshprisonchaplain">prison chaplain</a>
            at <a href="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> who had come to his trial at his
            request as a witness, but whose testimony did him neither good nor harm. Warden
            <a href="#melick">Melick</a> treated him as he treated all the other
            prisoners, with kindness. He had a guard take him out for a walk every other day
            and he enjoyed the privilege. Nevertheless he would often become unruly. One
            morning he asked the doctor for some <q>"dope."</q> He was promptly
            refused and he appealed to the warden. Colonel <a href="#melick">Melick</a> came to see him but also refused. Then <a href="#prince">Prince</a> asked the reason why. The <a href="#melick">Warden</a>
            gave as his reason, that the <i>negro (sic) </i> would not be able to make peace
            with his maker with his brains clouded with poison. From time to time he asked
            for <q>"dope"</q> and each time he was refused. He was hoping that the
            supreme court would either grant him a new trial or change the sentence from
            death to life imprisonment; but that high tribunal concurred with the trial
            court and fixed the twentieth day of April, 1913 for the execution. <a href="#prince">He</a> now turned to the pardon board to save his life
            from the gallows. A hearing was granted, and those interested appeared before,
            the board in the prison library. Mr. <a href="#hager">Hager</a>, deputy
            county attorney, appeared for the state. His speech was short and to the point.
            He stated that the murderer had had a fair and impartial trial and that the
            supreme court had concurred with the trial court. Mr. <a href="#howard1">Howard</a>, his attorney, pleaded that the sentence of his client be
            commuted to life imprisonment and so did also several good Christians, who do
            not believe in capital punishment. The fake religionists also appeared in his
            behalf that they might get a little notoriety. Within a few days the board
            reported to the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>. Doctor <a href="#butler">Butler</a>'s report was a most interesting document. It
            set forth how the doctor, anticipating this hearing, had set out to investigate
            the past life of the murderer, and had traced his wanderings from time to time.
            It showed how <a href="#prince">Prince</a> had been a criminal since
            boyhood, and how he kept up his crime behind the prison walls. To commute his
            sentence to life imprisonment was to place in jeopardy the lives of the prison
            officials and guards at the prison. Mr. <a href="#maggi">Maggi</a>
            concurred with Doctor <a href="#butler">Butler</a>, while Mr. <a href="#yeiser">Yeiser</a> being opposed to capital punishment favored
            life sentence. The governor did not overrule the findings of the two courts and
            the pardon board, and refused to interfere.</p>
         
         
         <p>Much has been said for and against capital punishment, and several bills were
            drafted to abolish it in the last legislature. From time immemorial, criminals
            have been executed, and for various offenses. This fact, however, is in my
            opinion no argument in its favor. For instance, in the year of 1279 two hundred
            and eighty Jews were hanged in England for clipping coin; and a few years later
            the <a href="#mayorexeter">mayor of <a href="#exeter">Exeter</a></a>, England, and the town marshal were hanged for leaving the
            town gates unfastened one night. During the reign of <a href="#henryVIII">Henry the VIII</a> thirty-seven thousand criminals, both men and women,
            were executed for various offenses. Among these, one woman was put to death on
            the gallows for stealing a shillings worth of lace. But as the world progresses
            the laws change, and today only murderers forfeit their lives upon the gallows,
            and even these are given every chance possible to prove their innocence. Take
            for instance, this murderer <a href="#prince">Prince</a>. It was a clear
            case of premeditated, willful and uncalled for murder, yet it took fourteen
            months to take his case through two courts before the pardon board and the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>, before he paid the penalty for his
            crime.</p>
         
         
         <p>In my opinion capital punishment should not be abolished in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, for neither in this nor any other western
            state does a life sentence mean life. A life termer goes, and is a good
            prisoner, and in from ten to thirteen years and often much less, some
            kind-hearted governor commutes his sentence. Even if a life sentence meant a
            life sentence a prisoner serving life would have nothing to lose by committing a
            murder in the prison, for the courts could not add any more years to his
            sentence. With capital punishment abolished, what could they do to him? That is
            why several states that have abolished capital punishment regret it, and why
            some return to it. Should it be abolished in <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, I would suggest that the <a href="#california">California</a> law be passed here. Out there they have a clause in the
            law abolishing capital punishment - that any prisoner who is serving a sentence
            in the pen and who kills a prison officer, attache or guard, shall forfeit his
            life. To this clause I would suggest adding: <q>"or another
               convict,"</q> for the inmates are just as much subject to the wrath
            of these murderers, as are the officials. </p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
         
         <h1>THE HANGING </h1>
         
         
         <p>Sitting in his little cell, <a href="#prince">Prince</a> saw his doomsday
            last approaching. He still hoped that at the last minute either the legislature
            or the governor would change his sentence to life imprisonment. One of the
            soulsavers dropped into my office one day to ask my opinion of what she called a
            splendid plan that ought to give satisfaction to all concerned, and which she
            intended to take up with the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>. Her plan was
            to ask the governor to commute the sentence to life imprisonment that he might
            turn over his earnings in the prison to the widow of his victim. I told her that
            she was only wasting her time, for well did I know that the <a href="#msdavis">widow</a> would not touch anything that came from the
            murderer; and furthermore, all the money in the state would not make up her
            loss, for to her it was not a matter of dollars and cents. The suggestion was
            indeed a most ridiculous one, Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> went out
            of office during the month of January, and was pleased that he did not have to
            superintend the execution. This became the duty of the new warden, Mr. <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>. This is usually the duty of the deputy
            warden, but before accepting the office as deputy warden, Mr. <a href="#harmon">Harmon</a> made an agreement with Mr. <a href="#Fenton">Fenton</a> not to take any part in the hanging. From all
            corners of the state came requests for permission to attend the execution, all
            of which were denied. The warden intended to obey the law that prescribes that
            only those needed as attendants - the coroner, six physicians, and the
            prisoner's spiritual adviser, are to be admitted. Printed cards were issued to
            these gentlemen and also to <i>The (sic) </i> representative for the <cite>"Lincoln Star"</cite> and two other press
            correspondents. It was a strange coincidence that the murderer as well as the
            rope with which he was hung, both came from <a href="#cincinati">Cincinnati</a>. The rope cost ten dollars, has a knot tied, has been
            tested and is ready for business. The twentieth day of April came along. It was
            a beautiful spring day. From early morning and up to noon there came a stream of
            curiosity seekers who begged to be admitted. They were all refused, yet they
            lingered around the corridors until the execution was over with.</p>
         
         
         <p>The hanghouse is located in the southwest corner of the prison. Judging from
            outside appearances it could be easily taken for a woodshed. When not in use it
            serves to store the box lumber belonging to the broom-factory. All of this had
            been taken out. Mr. <a href="#stryker">Stryker</a>, the state executioner,
            had put the gallows in order, tested the rope, installed the electric batteries,
            and everything was ready for business. I must explain that the trap door upon
            which the murderer stands is sprung by electricity; then his body shoots into
            the pit underneath. There are six buttons to press. Six men press these buttons
            upon a sign from the executioner. None of the six knows which
            <i>par-ticular (sic) </i> button springs the door. The hanging was set for two
            o'clock. The attendants began to arrive and were furnished with admission cards.
            With Doctor <a href="#sward">Sward</a> came his <a href="#assistantsurgeon">assistant surgeon</a>, who was to make an
            analysis of the murderer's blood. They all marched to the hanghouse and took
            their seats. Shortly afterward came the condemned man, walking steadily and
            erect between Warden <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a> and Reverend <a href="#may">May</a>. Not a word was spoken, everything was quiet. The
            <a href="#prince">prisoner</a> had no statement to make and mounted
            the scaffold. He was dressed in a neat black suit, black tie, black hose and
            slippers bought that same day for the occasion. He walked upon the scaffold, the
            black cap was quickly adjusted, the six buttons were touched, his body swung
            into the pit and his soul passed into eternity, there to meet its fate. This was
            only a matter of three minutes. In thirteen minutes he was pronounced dead, the
            body turned over to the undertaking <i>es-tablishment (sic) </i> of <cite>Castle, Roper &amp; Matthews</cite>, and by them
            shipped to <a href="#ohio">Ohio</a> for burial.</p>
         
         
         <p>I have been in the banking business for many years but never once was I called on
            to cash a check executed by a dead man; but on that evening Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> presented to me for payment, a check drawn
            by <a href="#prince">Prince</a> on the prison bank and payable to him for
            the balance of <a href="prince">Prince</a>'s account. As it was small,
            less than ten dollars, I honored the check. The next day came another preacher,
            the one who accused us of peddling the choicest steaks, and put in a claim for
            <q>"something left him by <a href="#prince">Prince</a>."</q> I
            told him there was nothing for him, and he departed much disappointed, reminding
            me of a vulture that, hovering over what was once a dead body, finds only the
            bones. The Rev. Doctor <a href="#may">May</a>, who had been the murderer's
            spiritual adviser, who at his own expense had made the trips to the prison to be
            of real service to the <i>condemned. man, (sic) </i> presented no check, nor did he
            make any claims. That sincere and good man will reap his harvest close to the
            throne.</p>
         
         
         <p>It was a great relief indeed to have this matter off our hands. Had the sentence
            been commuted this man would have been an everlasting source of trouble, as
            sooner or later he would have killed one or more men. Eleven men have paid the
            penalty upon these same gallows. <a href="#prince">Prince</a>'s hanging is
            the last in the state, for the gallows have been torn down to be replaced with
            the electric chair. Let us hope that nobody will ever sit in it.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
         
         <h1>A "RESIGNATION" </h1>
         
         
         <p>Following the assassination of Mr. <a href="#davis">Davis</a> a deputation
            of twenty-nine ministers of Lincoln called on Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> and asked to inspect the prison. We never knew who had
            arranged this meeting, but we were satisfied that they were earnest and
            well-meaning men who were out there for the public welfare and to see if the
            place was really as black as it had been painted. The warden met them at the
            door and gave them a cordial reception. Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> did not know of their coming and appeared much surprised over
            it. The ministers were given a chance to see the entire prison and to inspect
            the food. They afterwards made several suggestions as to certain improvements in
            the prison but found nothing against the administration. They came like
            gentlemen and departed in peace.</p>
         
         
         <p>But the little army of old women soul savers were busier than ever and more
            underhanded work went on than ever before. A blow from the assassin's dagger had
            removed one of the obstacles from their path, but another one still remained,
            and he too ought to go that they again could hold high carnival at the
            prison.</p>
         
         
         <p>I recall how Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> came to me one evening
            and made inquiry about the amount of money to the credit of the prisoners. I
            told him, that like in any other bank we did not reveal the balances of our
            depositors. <q>"Well,"</q> he said, <q>"it matters not so much to me
               what the individual has on deposit, what I want to know is general
               statistics. The story goes down on the streets of Lincoln that some men have
               so much on deposit while others have much more. We will classify these men
               and call those men who have one thousand dollars or over, Class A. And those
               with between five hundred and one thousand dollars Class B, etc. What I want
               to know is how many are in Class B and so on."</q> I refused to get him
            this information and suggested that he get it from the warden. He walked away.
            When the warden came into the office I told him about having refused the
            chaplain this information, and he said, <q>"You were right. He is here to
               preach and not to meddle with the accounts."</q> A few days later the
            chaplain called on Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a> and complained
            against the warden. The visit terminated in the chaplain
            <q>"resigning"</q> his position at the invitation of the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> to do so. The warden was notified, and soon
            the chaplain came to the prison, went to his room, gathered up his belongings
            and departed. No tears were shed over his departure - all felt relieved. We
            looked forward to days of peace and happiness. </p>

         <p>Never shall I forget the fourteenth day of March, 1912. A blizzard was raging, it
            was an awful day, a day just fitted for the commission of a crime. Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> came into the office about seven
            o'clock. It was his fifty-fifth birthday. As he passed by my desk I
            congratulated him and wished him many happy years. He thanked me and went on to
            his desk where he worked until eleven o'clock. He got up several times to look
            out. The cars were not running regularly. He told me that he wanted to go and
            see Mr. <a href="#huckins">Huckins</a>, publisher of the <cite>"Lincoln Herald,"</cite> but thought he would postpone
            the trip on account of the weather. He tried to get Mr. <a href="#huckins">Huckins</a> by phone, but the phone refused to work. At noon he went
            upstairs and sat down and talked with his mother for a while.</p>
         
         
         <p>After dinner the deputy warden, Mr. <a href="#wagner">Wagner</a>, sent a
            note to me asking me to come to his office. This was between one and two
            o'clock. I went in there, and Mr. <a href="#wagner">Wagner</a> explained
            that he wanted me to write to <a href="#kansascity">Kansas City</a> to get
            the record of an inmate. I left right away, and no sooner had I sat down at my
            desk than I heard six shots fired in the chapel in rapid succession. I rushed to
            the door and looked into the turnkey room, where I saw <a href="#pahl">Claus
               Pahl</a>, the turnkey crouching on the floor. I asked him what was the
            matter. He turned and looked at me but did not answer. I noticed that he was
            very pale and his eyes protruded from his head. To me he looked like an insane
            person, and I thought that it was he who had gone mad and had fired the shots.
            Afterwards I realized that he was <q>"scared to death."</q> If he
            had thrown his keys into the hall when I spoke to him or departed by the side
            door, he would have saved the day; but doing as he did, he simply lost it. For a
            minute I retired to the office. Soon the usher, Mr. <a href="#heilman">Heilman</a>, came staggering in and fell upon the floor seriously
            wounded. The good old man had heard the noise and rushed out of his office into
            the <i>hail (sic) </i> to see what was going on. He was struck by a bullet fired by
            <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> who stood guard while <a href="#gray">"Shorty Gray"</a> was working on the door leading from the
            library into the turnkey. Poor Mr. <a href="#heilman">Heilman</a> fell
            upon the floor. Then the chief clerk, Mr. <a href="#ward">Ward</a>, and I
            picked him up and placed him gently in a chair. Just at that time I heard a
            terrific explosion, that of blowing the lock from the door. At the same time
            Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> came running down stairs,
            grabbed his gun, and standing in the doorway kept shooting at the desperadoes,
            who returned the fire. At the same time, Chief Clerk <a href="#ward">Ward</a> made a bee-line for the vault, pulled the inside doors partly
            shut and remained there during the fight. At the same time <a href="#robb">Steward Robb</a> ran into his office and shut the door, but I want to
            give Mr. <a href="#robb">Robb</a> credit for not posing as a hero and for
            telling the truth. He told the public that he was unarmed and hence retreated to
            his office and shut the door. Thus Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> and I were the only two left on the floor. As the warden
            advanced I followed him, 'confident that he would conquer the enemy. Never
            before did I see Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> move about so
            quickly as he did there when fighting for his state and his honor. There was a
            strange look upon his face - to me he looked many years younger. Altogether he
            fired five shots, the desperadoes firing back at him, one bullet landing in the
            door casing above his head. In firing the fourth shot he leaned too much forward
            and a bullet struck him in the side. He turned around and for a minute stooped
            over as if he was going to fall but suddenly jumped forward and fired another
            shot. By this time he was getting weak and fell to the floor. I kneeled down
            beside him and comforted him.</p>
         
         
         <p>For a few minutes he sat in an upright position but grew weaker and weaker, and
            with the words, <q>"Oh, my Lord,"</q> he fell backwards on the floor. At
            the same time the desperadoes made the turnkey hold up his hands and deliver
            over the keys. Then the turnkey went into hiding in the cellar. They opened the
            door leading out into the hail and ran out into the open, firing into the office
            as they ran. One bullet which was perhaps intended for me ploughed through a
            large calendar hanging on the wall, cut it in two pieces, and landed in the
            window casing. I wish to make mention right here of a heroine, who was never
            mentioned in the newspapers, but who deserves great credit for what she did. I
            do not even know her name. I refer to the <a href="#heroine">Bell telephone
               operator</a> on duty that afternoon. As the desperadoes disappeared I left
            the warden for a minute, told the <a href="#heroine">Bell operator</a>
            what had happened and asked her to notify the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>, the sheriff the chief of police, Mr. <a href="#hughes">Hughes</a>, manager of <a href="nebraskabankers">Nebraska Bankers
               Association</a>, and to send out a general alarm. This she did, and did it
            well. I then returned to the warden. He was not bleeding at all, but was getting
            weaker and weaker. Just then his brother, <a href="#delahunty">John
               Delahunty</a>, night yardmaster at the prison, came downstairs. He had
            heard the noise and came to investigate. He had dressed hurriedly and had on no
            shoes or hose. He came down just as the desperadoes slammed the door. Had he
            come one minute sooner perhaps he too would have forfeited his life. Just then
            the warden's revolver fell from his hand. I handed it to <a href="#delahunty">John</a>. I also told him what had happened that the
            turnkey doors were wide open and that there was nothing to prevent all the
            prisoners from walking out. He went in search of <a href="#pahl">Turnkey
               Pahl</a>, but that gentleman was nowhere to be found. He then went to lock
            the door that leads from the chapel into the yard and thus prevented anyone from
            going out. At that time, shaking and quivering, the chief clerk, Mr. <a href="#ward">Ward</a> emerged from the vault. Also Mr. <a href="#evans">Henry Evans</a> was the first to appear upon the scene.
            Mr. <a href="#evans">Evans</a> was at that time a night guard. He is an
            ex-soldier, one of the bravest men at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>
            and a crack shot. He was asleep when the shooting took place in the chapel, and
            being awakened by the noise dressed hurriedly and went to look into the chapel.
            He saw at a glance what was going on, but having no arms he went to the chapel
            tower guard, and asked for the use of his gun for a short time. The tower guard
            refused. <a href="#evans">Evans</a> is a sharpshooter, and if he had
            appeared on the scene in time I doubt if the desperadoes would have gotten away.
            Mr. <a href="#evans">Evans</a> went back into the prison and got together
            a bunch of men to carry the warden to his room. Among them was <a href="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</a> (called the "Convict
            Physician" by the soulsavers) and also <a href="#thomas">Jim
               Thomas</a>, the <i>colored (sic) </i> clerk at the prison cigar stand. As
            they walked into the office the then chief clerk was calling up the governor's
            office. He was much excited and was telling that there was a general mutiny.
            <a href="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</a> went over to him and told him
            that the boys were as quiet as mice. This is how the story started that there
            was a mutiny and a general outbreak at the prison.</p>
         
         <p>In the meantime we carried the wounded warden upstairs and laid him on his bed.
            At his left side were the assistant surgeon, Doctor <a href="#welch">Welch</a>, and Mr. <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a> administering
            to him. I was at his right side, holding his hand in mine. I asked Doctor <a href="#welch">Welch</a> if there was any hope, and he thought there was.
            He injected some fluid into his left arm. As he did that the warden opened his
            eyes for a minute, looked at me, squeezed my hand a last farewell and passed
            into the other world. I could hardly realize that he was dead. It was as if some
            strange power held me there; and for about half an hour I sat there with his
            hand in mine and could not leave him. Then Mr. <a href="#robb">Robb</a>,
            the steward, came along. I asked him to lock the doors, as the warden wore some
            valuable diamonds. We locked the doors and went down stairs. The telephone had
            done its work and people were arriving at the pen. First came a reporter from
            the <cite>"Lincoln Daily Star,"</cite> the prison
            physician, Doctor <a href="#spradling">Spradling</a>, Dr. <a href="#finney">E. B. Finney</a>, Colonel <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, <a href="#matthews">"Jack" Matthews</a>, coroner of the
            county, Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> with three of his deputies,
            Chief of Detectives <a href="#schmidt">John Schmidt</a>, Chief of Police
            <a href="#hunger">Hunger</a> with eight officers, and former Deputy
            Sheriff <a href="#dawson">Jim Dawson</a>. Soon Adjutant General <a href="#phelps">Phelps</a> with an orderly arrived. He ordered fifty men
            from Company "F" to report at the prison immediately. The street cars
            were not running on account of the snow so the men were sent out on a special
            train over the <a href="burlington">Burlington</a> route. They were in
            charge of Major <a href="#antles">H. H. Antles</a>, and Captain <a href="#hall">Phil Hall</a>. Major <a href="#birkner">John M.
               Birkner</a> and Doctor <a href="#sward">Sward</a> also came out with
            a squad of the hospital corps, and the prison was now under martial law with
            Adjutant General <a href="#phelps">Phelps</a> in charge. The chapel became
            the headquarters for the militia and they patrolled all the buildings. When I
            left Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>'s room and returned to the
            office, I learned what had taken place on the inside of the prison, and also
            that the perpetrators of the bloody work were <a href="#gray">Charles
               Taylor</a>, alias Shorty Gray, No. 5762, <a href="#dowd">John
               Dowd</a>, No. 5873, and <a href="#morley">Charles Morley</a>, No.
            5569. These men had sneaked out of the broom shop and gone to the chapel. They
            entered through the south door, which was never locked at that time, and while
            one of them covered <a href="#thomas">Jim Thomas</a> the cigar clerk, with
            a gun, the other two went to the deputy warden's office. They did not give Mr.
            <a href="#wagner">Wagner</a> a chance to defend himself, but fired
            several shots into his breast, from which he died almost instantly. Hearing the
            noise, Mr. <a href="#doody">Thomas Doody</a>, keeper of the west cell
            house, armed himself and ran into the chapel. The desperadoes jumped behind
            pillars and kept firing at him. Mr. <a href="#doody">Doody</a> returned
            the fire, but soon he fell, seriously wounded. He managed to crawl out of the
            building, was assisted back into the cell house, and Mr. <a href="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</a> was sent for to administer to him. Had not the "Convict
            Physician," the doctor without a license, as Judge <a href="#frost">Frost</a> calls him, arrived, there is no doubt but what <a href="#doody">Doody</a> would have lost his life. Shortly after the
            shooting of <a href="#doody">Doody</a>, came the explosion and the escape
            of the murderers. The guards on the wails and in the shops heard the explosion.
            They did not know what was going on but all watched carefully. Every man seized
            arms of some kind and prison discipline prevailed. In the shops not a man was
            permitted to leave his machine. Mr. <a href="#Cockeley">Cokeley</a>, for
            many years yardmaster at the prison and in charge of the yard on the day of the
            outbreak, now gave orders to the convicts to cease work and march to their
            cells. His conduct during the excitement showed bravery and devotion to duty. He
            was assisted by Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a>.</p>
         
         
         <p>One by one the shops were emptied and all the men locked in their cells. The boys
            behaved nicely except one, a horse thief from <a href="benkelman">Benkelman</a>, who was noisy. He was taken to the hole by Chief of Police
            <a href="#hunger">Hunger</a>. Mr. <a href="#doody">Doody</a> was
            taken to his room and attended to. Mr. <a href="#slattery">T. E.
               Slattery</a>, for many years a prison official in this and <a href="#colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="#wyoming">Wyoming</a>
            prisons, and a brave man, took charge of the west cell house. The men were all
            curious to learn what had taken place. When told that the warden was killed they
            were grief-stricken. Many wept bitterly for the warden was beloved by all the
            boys. <q>"Poor <a href="#delahunty">Jim</a>,"</q> some of them said,
            <q>"he was strictly on the square."</q> I heard many of them express
            hopes that the murderers would be captured and hung. So intense was the feeling
            against the desperadoes by the other prisoners that many of them would be
            willing to start out and hunt them, put them to death and then return to their
            prison home.</p>
         
         
         <p>Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a> was not in the city when I called
            the office but his private secretary, Mr. <a href="#fuller">Fuller</a>,
            got busy and located the governor at <a href="#auburn">Auburn</a> where he
            was snowbound, and told him of the trouble. It was fortunate that the governor
            was in <a href="#auburn">Auburn</a> and not in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, for down there he made arrangements with the <a href="#belltelephonecompany">Bell Telephone Company</a> for the
            uninterrupted use of the line to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. He
            immediately got Adjutant General <a href="#phelps">Phelps</a> on the line
            and gave the general instructions as to what to do. The <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> was grief-stricken over the murder and made preparations to
            get a special train to take him to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. In the
            meantime he instructed General <a href="#phelps">Phelps</a> to take charge
            and appointed Steward <a href="#robb">Mont Robb</a> as Warden pro tem. He
            also instructed Mr. <a href="#maggi">Maggi</a>, chairman of the pardon
            board, to proceed to the prison and look after the boys. Mr. <a href="#maggi">Maggi</a> learned that there was to be no supper served
            that evening, but he proceeded to the kitchen and had supper prepared and served
            in the cells. Posses now left the prison and went in every direction; pictures
            were made of the murderers and sent broadcast; telegrams were sent to every
            officer in the state; and all the sheriffs in the eastern part of <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> immediately organized posses and took up
            the trail. At the prison telephone inquiries kept coming in till after midnight.
            At two o'clock I went to bed, but was too downhearted to sleep and several times
            I had to get up and walk the floor. </p>

         <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
         
         <h1> OUR MARTYRED WARDEN</h1>
         
         <p><a href="#delahunty">James Delahunty</a> was born in <a href="#peoria">Peoria</a>, <a href="#illinois">Illinois</a>, March 14, 1857, and
            the tragic feature of the killing was the fact that the day was the fifty-fifth
            anniversary of his birth; and on the same hour of the day as occurred his birth
            also occurred his death. He came to <a href="#clay">Clay</a> county, <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, about twenty-eight years ago with his
            parents, settling on a farm now occupied by his family two miles northeast of
            <a href="#clay">Clay</a> Center. <a href="#delahunty">Jim</a>,
            as he was universally known, was an honorable, upright, good and true man and
            was respected and beloved by all with whom he came in contact. He was well
            educated, and was fitted for any position in life. For two years he served as
            deputy county clerk of <a href="#clay">Clay</a> county, and about ten
            years at the prison in various positions. He served under five governors and
            rose from steward to deputy warden and afterwards to warden.</p>
         
         <p>His memory was superior to any I have ever seen. He could remember the names and
            even the numbers of inmates at <a href="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</a>. He would call them by name when they came back after
            having been out for years. He considered a prisoner a man, a fellow being with a
            heart and a soul, and treated them with kindness. He believed that the prison
            was a place of safekeeping and not a place of punishment. He was a Catholic but
            believed that this is a free country and that each person has a right to worship
            his God as his heart desires. When it came to business among employees and
            inmates, Catholics and Protestants all looked alike to him. He was a quiet,
            dignified man who said but little, but what he did say you could depend upon.
            His word was as good as a government bond. The inmates used to say, <q>"If
               Warden <a href="#delahunty">Jim</a> says so, you can depend upon it
               absolutely."</q> He was charity from the bottom of his heart, especially
            to the outgoing inmates. This is</p>

         <p>something entirely unknown to the public, as well as to his own relatives, but I
            came to know it during the last four months of his life, when I enjoyed his
            confidence. He has helped many a man out of prison, and made several long trips
            at his own expense to plead with court officials in the prisoner's behalf. I
            have known of relatives of the prisoners, who came to Lincoln and their money
            gave out. Quietly and without any advertising he helped them along, and at times
            sent them to their home. I have known of two cases where a prisoner after
            serving a long sentence was to be rearrested and taken to another state to stand
            trial on another charge. Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> being
            satisfied that they had been punished more than sufficient, and that they were
            going to lead upright lives, instead of accepting a reward, corresponded with
            the prosecutors and had the cases stricken from the records I have known of a
            prisoner, being a strange man in a strange land, standing upon the scaffold,
            ready to forfeit his life upon the gallows, turn to Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> and with tears streaming down his face, say: <q>"<a href="#delahunty">Jim</a>, don't let them cut my body to
               pieces."</q> Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> as he shook his
            hand and <i>bad (sic) </i> him a last farewell, said: <q>"No, my boy, I will see
               that you get a Christian burial."</q> And he did. When, urged on by a
            little gang of hypocrites, three desperadoes with murder in their hearts, set
            out to dynamite and shoot their way out of prison, there stood the brave <a href="#delahunty">James Delahunty</a>, the warden, and unaided fought
            the three of them. When finally he fell to the floor mortally wounded his last
            words were, <q>"Oh, my Lord."</q> Such a man was <a href="#delahunty">James Delahunty</a>. Is it a wonder that his fellow townsmen honored him
            with public office, or that five governors placed him in a responsible position
            in the service of the state? Or is it it strange that every convict in the
            prison but one, signs a petition and presents it to Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a> to retain Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> as
            deputy warden?</p>
         
         <p>No matter how good and faithful a public officer is, he is bound to make some
            enemies; and that same little gang of hypocrites whom he would not feed at the
            expense of the state nor let them run the prison, poisoned the mind of the
            public against him. Had it not been for their nefarious work, brave <a href="#delahunty">James Delahunty</a> would still have been in the land
            of the living.</p>
         
         
         <p>The funeral of Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> was held at nine
            o'clock on Wednesday, March twentieth, 1912 at the <a href="#cathedral">Catholic Cathedral</a> in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. Solemn
            requiem mass was held over the body. Father <a href="#moran">Moran</a> was
            celebrant, Father <a href="#dumphy">Dumphy</a> of Sutton, deacon; Father
            <a href="#bradley">Bradley</a>, sub-deacon and Father <a href="#loughlin">Loughlin</a>, master of ceremonies. There were many
            floral offerings. After the services were concluded the remains lay in state and
            were viewed by hundreds of people.</p>
         
         
         <p>The church was packed. <a href="#aldrich">Governor</a> and Mrs. <a href="#msaldrich">Aldrich</a>, Secretary of State Mr. <a href="#wait">Wait</a>, State Treasurer Mr. <a href="#george">George</a> and many other state, county and city officials attended. From
            all over the state came prominent men. From <a href="#clay">Clay</a>
            county came a large delegation of friends and former townsmen of the warden.
            Father <a href="#moran">Moran</a>, the Catholic chaplain at the
            penitentiary, preached the sermon. He paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of
            the deceased warden. He declared that the warden had died as only a brave man
            could die, in defense of the interests of the public. He thought that there
            could be no more heroic death than to fall at the post of duty. In closing the
            sermon he said: <q>"He will be long remembered by those who knew him, and he
               will soon be forgotten by those who <em>criticised (sic)</em> him, for
               they will be busy <em>criticising (sic)</em> someone else."</q></p>

         <h1>THE MURDERED OFFICIALS </h1>
         
         
         <p>The murdered deputy warden, <a href="#wagner">Henry Wagner</a>, had been
            connected with the prison for over eighteen years. For many years he served as
            guard, was then promoted to steward and rose to be the deputy warden: He was a
            quiet, kindhearted, generous man and a good prison man. He believed in strict
            discipline, played no favorites among the inmates who all looked alike to him.
            Mr. <a href="#wagner">Wagner</a> was a widower and had no relatives in the
            state. Mr. <a href="#heilman">E. G. Heilman</a>, the veteran usher, had
            been employed at the penitentiary for over five years - first as chief clerk for
            two years. When Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a> was appointed and his
            chief clerk did not understand the prison system of bookkeeping, Mr. <a href="#heilman">Heilman</a> was retained as usher and looked after the
            most of the books besides. He also served his county as clerk, and served the
            state as assistant secretary.He was a good accountant, a fine penman and a man
            of high education and refinement. He possessed a sunny disposition, always
            happy, always jolly and in good humor. As a young man he fought for his country,
            and had he not been shot down unexpectedly by the murderers' bullets, he too
            would have given account of himself. What a pity that a good and brave man
            should lose his life in such a manner. Mr. <a href="#doody">Thomas
               Doody</a> had also been connected with the prison for many years, first as
            guard and later on as cell keeper. He kept the big cell house clean and in good
            condition. He is a fine fellow, good-hearted, generous and humane. The inmates
            liked Mr. <a href="#doody">Doody</a>, for he treated them like men. His
            wounds were serious and we did not expect him to live; but through the care of
            Doctor <a href="#spradling">Spradling</a>, assisted by <a href="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</a>, he pulled through though crippled
            for life.</p>
         
         
         <p>The legislature appropriated five thousand dollars for Mr. <a href="#doody">Doody</a> as a reward for his bravery, as well as to pay for bills
            incurred while being sick. The relatives of Mr. <a href="#heilman">Heilman</a> also received a small amount. The friends and relatives of
            all the murdered prison officials will derive comfort from the public
            consciousness that they died faithful to the service allotted them by their
            fellow men, and unfalteringly gave their lives to the service of society, as
            verily as does - the soldier who falls on the field of battle in the service of
            his country. </p>

         <h1>BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER </h1>
         
         
         <p>Those were gloomy days following upon the murder of the warden. The place seemed
            so strange and empty without him. Everybody looked sad and said but little. It
            was indeed a sad sight to look at <a href="#frank">Frank</a>, the warden's
            janitor and messenger. Every morning the colored man used to come to the office
            and shine the warden's shoes. He entered the office in silence and left the same
            way. To <a href="#frank">Frank</a>, the warden was the greatest man in the
            world as well as his best friend. On the morning following the murder, <a href="#frank">Frank</a> came into the office, and looking at the vacant
            chair wept bitterly. <q>"This place is so lonesome without the warden; I wish
               I could have gone with him,"</q> said the faithful colored man. For over
            a week he went along with his work grief-stricken and without speaking to
            anyone, and eating barely enough to sustain life. The following week was
            <q>"letter day"</q> at the prison and nearly every inmate
            wrote a letter. All deplored the murder of the warden and many spoke bitterly of
            the murderers and those who instigated the murder. The following letter written
            by a poor sick boy to his mother in <a href="#siouxcity">Sioux City</a>,
            <a href="#iowa">Iowa</a>, is a fair example of the many that went out: </p>
         
         <p><a href="#lancaster">LANCASTER</a>, <a href="#nebraska">NEBRASKA</a>,
            March 25, 1912. <q>"My DARLING <a href="#georgemother">MOTHER</a>: I
               will write you a few lines to let you know that I am out of the hospital and
               am feeling better. <a href="#georgemother">Mother</a>, I don't know if
               you will ever get this letter, but I hope you do. I know that you have read
               in the papers about the awful murder of our good <a href="#delahunty">warden</a>. I know that he is up among the angels in heaven now. <a href="#georgemother">Mother</a>, I want you to know that I was
               neither hurt nor mixed up in that awful murder. The warden was on the square
               and we all liked him. I sat on the hospital steps the other day when he came
               along. He walked slowly and looked as if he was worried. He asked me how I
               felt. I told him that I was getting better, but had no appetite, that the
               only thing I could eat was an orange, but that I had no money to buy one
               with. He said that he would see that I got some. That same day he brought me
               a big bag of fine oranges and told me that he would bring some more. <a href="#georgemother">Mother</a>, I want you to pray for his mother,
               she is so good and kind. Colonel <a href="#presson">Presson</a>
               preached a fine sermon the other day, for the chaplain got fired. We have
               <i>anew (sic) </i> chaplain now, he has not preached yet, but he has gone
               from cell to cell and visited with us. He is a young man and I know that his
               heart is not petrified. Mother, pray for me that I may live and get home in
               August, when my time is up. Love to all, <a href="#george">GEORGE</a>."</q></p>
         
         
         <p>Letters of sympathy came pouring in from all corners of the world and hundreds of
            letters came to the inmates deploring the murder. There was grief and sorrow in
            every place, except in <a href="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>. Never during the
            life of the warden had the former chaplain gone to him and talked over prison
            matters. Never had he complained to him, never had he given an interview or
            explanation to a <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> paper - never. But when
            the warden lay cold in death, he gives out a statement to a little socialist
            paper way down in <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a>. I am not saying anything
            against socialism for it has many good features, but I am not in sympathy with
            those socialists, who, during a spell of over enthusiasm, go too far and become
            anarchists, and use their sheets to uphold and further bloody murder and many
            lesser crimes. This paper is supposed to stand for those who are poor and
            oppressed. It was <a href="#gray">"Shorty Gray</a>'s" favorite
            paper. Poor, oppressed <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a>! What a shame to
            land them in prison for robbing banks. Being the organ of <a href="#gray">Gray</a>, it did not surprise me that Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> should also make use of it. Now I have already described to
            my readers the hyena that digs into the grave and devours the dead bodies of
            those whom it did not have courage to attack while they were on earth. I may be
            a low specimen of humanity, I may have many sins, but I am no grave robber, no
            hyena. Let the dead rest in peace. For that reason I shall not say anything
            against the publisher of the paper that contained Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson's</a> letter, as he, the publisher, lies
            <i>hi (sic) </i> his grave, dead at his own hands; and furthermore, as a young
            woman, a mere child, figures in this matter, my lips are sealed. I hope that God
            in His tender mercy will forgive this man his sins. </p>
         
         
         <p>I wonder if my readers ever had any premonitions. I once had a premonition, when
            as a boy I made a raid upon my <a href="#authormother">mother</a>'s pantry
            and did away with a lot of jam. I had a premonition of something coming that I
            could not shake off, and the <em>premonitition (sic)</em> grew stronger and
            stronger as I saw my <a href="authormother">mother</a> approaching with a
            paddle. And out in the penitentiary, an old fellow who stole a horse in <a href="#gardencounty">Garden County</a>, told me that he, too, had a
            premonition that he could not shake off - a <em>premonitition (sic)</em> of
            something coming. He too was right, for the sheriff was coming. But, I beg to
            apologize to my reader for getting away from my subject, the statement of
            Chaplain <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> in the little <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a> paper. It reads as follows: </p>
         
         <p>
            "I resigned as chaplain of <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> state
            prison because I could no longer work with Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>. His methods of dealing with prisoners and mine, were
            materially different. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> considered a
            prisoner not a man but a thing without rights or feelings. He believed a
            prison a place of punishment, and I, a place of reformation. His methods
            were brutalizing the men and making them desperate. The guards reflected his
            spirit after convict <a href="#prince">Prince</a> killed Deputy Warden
            <a href="#davis">Davis</a>. I had a premonition of something
            coming that I could not shake off. I could do nothing because nobody would
            pay any attention to me. The powers that <i>be (sic) </i> treated me with
            contempt. I felt that the only thing to do was to resign and let those who
            were stubbornly insisting on having their own way assume the responsibility
            for what would happen. <a href="#noah">Noah</a> preached righteousness
            for a hundred and twenty years, but it took a deluge to move things. The
            angel tried to save <a href="#sodom">Sodom</a>, but it took fire to
            clean the city. It has taken startling events to change things at the
            prison. All my protests against conditions were received as the vaporings of
            a sentimental old man. My suggestions of prison reform were taken as the
            weakness of a childish preacher. Seven men are now dead and the whole state
            is shocked. This has changed things, and we are getting daily messages now
            on prison reform from unexpected sources. A little of this six months ago
            would have saved the lives of those now lying cold in death. The state
            doesn't need new buildings half so bad as it needs a little humanity at work
            in the ones we now have. I hated to leave my work and the poor prisoners,
            many of whom I had learned to love, but I had to do it."
            </p>
         
         
         <p>To the uninitiated, to the stranger, this sounds good; but let us analyze it and
            see if he is right, for even preachers make blunders once in a while. If they
            did not, there would not be so large a colony of them in <a href="#singsing">Sing Sing</a> prison, for it is a fact that there are more preachers
            there than there are bar-keepers. And what are they there for? Not many are
            there for stealing, no they are mostly there for crimes against other persons,
            against the other sex especially, for crimes against the home. These preachers,
            at any rate blundered, and failed to practice what they preached. I have known a
            preacher to stand before the congregation and preach righteousness. He was taken
            to be a holy man by all-save by one young woman, who later on sent him to the
            place where stripes are worn. I mention this to impress upon my readers the fact
            that preachers do make mistakes. The statement of this holy man published in the
            <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a> paper is full of them. To publish a
            statement against, a man who lies cold in death is in itself a mistake, and is a
            cowardly act. It shows lack of broad mindedness and Christian charity. In
            besmirching the character of our <a href="#delahunty">departed warden</a>,
            he is wrong; and I will ask that my reader will turn back a few pages and read
            the chapter entitled "Our Martyred Warden." That chapter tells all about
            Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, and I will prove that I am right.
            Take that chapter, and at the same time the statement of the chaplain, to any of
            the five governors that Mr. <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> served
            under, and ask them which is right and which is wrong. Go to his home county,
            ask those among whom he lived for nearly thirty years and ask who is correct. He
            is right, however, where he says that he felt that the only thing to do was to
            resign-for Governor <a href="#aldrich"> Aldrich</a> felt so too. He says
            further that all his protests were received as the vaporings of a sentimental
            old man. Where and when did he protest? Never to Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>. In order to give this man a perfectly square deal before
            publishing this book, I sent him on the evening of September the seventeenth, by
            registered mail, a letter which I know that he received. In that I asked him
            five questions which he never saw fit to answer.</p>
         
         
         <p>When the warden was brutally murdered, an <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a> paper
            called up this chaplain by phone and asked what he thought about the murder. His
            answer was: <q>"I do not want to say anything just now, but I will have to
               admit that I am not exactly surprised.</q></p>

         <p>As soon as the men were locked in their cells following the escape of the
            desperadoes, a count was taken to determine how many had escaped. Three times
            the men were <i>were (sic) </i> counted, and each time the count fell three men
            short. As already stated these were <a href="#gray">Gray</a>, <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and <a href="#morley">Morley</a>. Of the
            three, <a href="#gray">Gray</a> was by far the most desperate. He had
            spent his life in crime and was an expert shot and dynamiter. Twice he served at
            <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>, each time for bank robbery. On his
            first trip he stated that he was a horse trainer, while on his last, he gave
            <q>"upholsterer"</q> as his trade, but no one ever knew of him doing
            any upholstering. With two pals he burglarized the bank at <a href="#lyons">Lyons</a> in 1902. He was taken to <a href="#tekamah">Tekamah</a>

            Attorney <a href="#cole">J. M. Cole</a>, a famous criminal lawyer of <a href="#kansascity">Kansas City</a>, represented the defendants. Hundreds
            of curiosity seekers and many friends of the dynamiters attended the trial. Mr.
            <a href="#cole">Cole</a> fought hard to save his clients, but after
            hearing the testimony of a number of witnesses the court announced that to his
            mind there was sufficient evidence to bind them over, and fixed their bail at
            two thousand dollars, which they were unable to furnish. Fearing a rescue by
            their friends the trio was immediately taken to <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>
            for safe keeping by Sheriff <a href="#phipps">Phipps</a> of <a href="#burtcounty">Burt County</a> and Sheriff <a href="#bauman">Bauman</a> of <a href="#dodgecounty">Dodge County</a>. These two
            sheriffs are large and powerful men, and know not what fear is. <a href="#gray">Gray</a> and one pal received ten years each, while the
            third was let off with seven. Later the supreme court reduced the sentences of
            the two ten year men to seven years. They served their sentences, and for a
            while there was nothing heard of them. But again in 1911, <a href="#gray">Gray</a> and two other pals, <a href="#forbes">Forbes</a> and <a href="#evans">Evans</a>, were caught on an island in the <a href="#platteriver">Platte river</a> alter dynamiting the bank at <a href="#giltner">Giltner</a>. They secured no currency but got away with
            twelve hundred dollars in coin, which they succeeded in burying before they:
            were captured. They had their preliminary hearing at <a href="#aurora">Aurora</a> and were immediately taken to the penitentiary for safe
            keeping. In July 1912 they were tried before Judge <a href="#corcoran">Corcoran</a>, at <a href="#aurora">Aurora</a>, were found guilty
            and received a sentence of from twenty-eight years to life in the penitentiary.
            They arrived at the prison heavily chained and were immediately put to work in
            the broom factory. <a href="#evans">Evans or "Slim Martin"</a>, as

         <h1> CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1>
         
         <h1>ON THE MURDERERS' TRAIL </h1>
         
         
         <p> When the three murderers slipped out of the front door they disappeared as if
            from the face of the earth. The posse scoured the country surrounding the
            penitentiary, and ran down clew upon clew without finding even a trace of them.
            All Thursday afternoon and night the posse kept up the search, and carefully
            inspected all clumps of brush and woods and looked into culverts and beneath
            bridges without results. Many dews had been run to earth but all failed; On
            Friday morning the sheriff swore in twenty additional deputies and kept a force
            of clerks busy sending out circulars to every officer in this and adjoining
            states. Chief of Police <a href="#hunger">Hunger</a> also added several
            special officers to his force. At <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>, Mr. <a href="#johnson">C. E. Johnson</a>, chief of the <a href="#nebraskabankers">Nebraska Bankers Association</a>'s secret
            service, also got busy and put out all of his men. Of all the officers in the
            state the bank robbers fear him the most on account of his systematic and
            never-tiring methods. Many a member of the safeblowers' colony has been
            compelled to leave the state to operate elsewhere on account of this man. <a href="#malone">James Malone</a>, chief special agent of the <a href="#burlingtonrailways">"Burlington,"</a> also joined in the
            search with a force of railroad detectives. By Friday morning the entire eastern
            and southern part of the state was covered by a dragnet maintained by hundreds
            of county and police officers and thousands of private individuals. </p>
         
         
         <p>Acting under the conviction that the men were in hiding in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, Chief <a href="#hunger">Hunger</a> and a force of men
            kept up a search of all rooming houses of doubtful character, and the entire
            police force kept a close watch on all suspicious characters. Friday passed by
            and still no clew. While the search was going on everything was quiet at the
            prison. On Friday noon, <a href="#robb">Steward Robb</a>, who was nearly
            exhausted from hard work, asked the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> to be
            relieved from the office of acting warden, and Mr. <a href="#rwhyers">R. W.
               Hyers</a>, deputy game warden, and a former warden of the prison, took his
            place. A thorough search was started at the prison commencing at the west cell
            house. Everything in the cells except the bed clothes was taken to chapel and
            stored there. The men were kept locked up and fed in their cells. Late on
            Saturday night came a clew indicating movements of the three fugitives. About an
            hour after leaving the prison they appeared at the dairy farm of <a href="dickman">Joseph Dickman</a> at <a href="#dickmanfarm">2709 Van
               Dorn Street</a>. They were first seen by the hired man, staggering through
            the drifts of snow, and indeed were a pitiful sight, wet and almost frozen. They
            were invited into the house, and it was then first seen that they were convicts.
            <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> acted as spokesman for the trio, assured the
            <a href="msdickman">lady</a> of the house that they were not going to
            hurt anyone, but just wanted a shelter. She kept cool, told them that she had to
            milk the cows, and asked them to go with her to the barn and help her with the
            work. They said they would. <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and <a href="#morley">Morley</a> went with her while <a href="#gray">Gray</a> remained in the house and kept watch over the telephone. When
            they entered the barn she asked them if they could milk, and they answered that
            they could not. Then she asked one of them to go up into the silo and throw down
            the ensilage. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> climbed up there and <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> filled the mangers with feed for the cows. When
            the chores were done they returned to the house and <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> pulled down the curtains. Mr. <a href="#dickman">Dickman</a>'s two sons returned from delivering milk, and their mother
            told them that the convicts were in the house and for them to keep quiet and to
            do as the men ordered. When the boys came in the murderers asked them the news
            in town. They related what they had heard. That was the first intimation Mrs.
            <a href="#msdickman">Dickman</a> had of them having committed murder. </p>
         
         
         <p>Supper was now served. <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and <a href="#morley">Morley</a> sat down with the family and ate heartily while <a href="#gray">Gray</a> went into the front room keeping vigil. When <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and <a href="#morley">Morley</a> had
            finished supper they went into the other room to watch and <a href="#gray">Gray</a> then sat down to eat. After supper they rested for a while, and
            <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> ordered one of the boys to hitch up the
            milkwagon and drive them to Lincoln. <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> patted the
            horses tenderly on their shoulders and said that he hated to take the horses out
            in such a storm. Before leaving they demanded three pairs of overalls which were
            given them. The men then shook hands with Mrs. <a href="#msdickman">Dickman</a> and thanked her for her kindness. They told her not to say
            anything about them having been there or the lives of the family would be in
            danger. <q>"Remember,"</q> they said, <q>"your boy is with us."</q>
            The boy was instructed to take them to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. At
            <a href="#twentiethandr">Twentieth and R Streets</a> they got off and
            disappeared in the darkness. While driving near <a href="#randolphstreet"><i>Rando1ph (sic) </i> street</a> the wagon became stuck in the snow. A
            kindhearted pedestrian passing by, assisted them to get out of the snow drifts.
            This afterwards proved to Chief of Police <a href="#hunger">Hunger</a>,
            homeward bound. In the meantime dews kept coming in by the score. From far away
            <a href="#alliance">Alliance</a> on the west to <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a> on the east came clews, all of which turned out wrong. A
            telephone message came in that the three men had been seen approaching the
            residence of Mr. <a href="#fedwa">Fedewa</a> near <a href="">Forty-second and
               Vine Streets</a>, and Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> and a posse
            of eleven men went out there and inquired if they had seen the men. Mrs. <a href="#msfedewa">Fedewa</a> said that they had not, and furthermore that
            she would not give shelter to such men. <q>"I am Irish,"</q> she said.
            <q>"<a href="#delahunty">Jim Delahunty</a> was a good Irishman
               and a good friend of ours, and we think too much of him to shelter his
               murderers. Every year I used to bring him a basket of cherries from our
               orchard."</q> The sheriff then searched the outbuildings, and finding no
            trace of the trio he and the posse departed. Another report came that the men
            were hiding in the "<a href="#robberscave">Robbers Cave</a>." These
            caves are located about two miles from the prison, and are a mecca for
            sightseers. A squad of men under command of Captain <a href="#kesterson">Kesterson</a> went into these sandstone caves and searched every nook and
            crevice in them. They also went to the ruins of an old deserted <a href="#papermill">paper mill</a>, made a thorough search of the
            premises, but no trace was found. Still another message came that the bandits
            had been seen approaching a straw stack close to the residence of the <a href="#tihen">Bishop Tihen</a>. Colonel <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> and Detective <a href="#schmitt">Schmitt</a> went to the stacks and instituted a thorough
            search, but again no trace as found. Finally came a telephone message that the
            men were seen walking the <a href="#burlingtonrailways"><a href="#burlington">Burlington</a> tracks</a> ten miles out of <a href="#havelock">Havelock</a>, heading for <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>. They were reported to be under the influence of liquor and
            were terrorizing the farmers whose homes they passed, securing food and clothes.
            The police of <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a> and <a href="#southomaha">South Omaha</a> were notified, and Chief <a href="#briggs">Briggs</a> put out sentinels to intercept them in case they left the
            railroad tracks when nearing <a href="#southomaha">South Omaha</a>. Early
            Monday morning came a message that a store in <a href="#murdock">Murdock</a> had been broken into and some duck coats, artics, shotguns
            and ammunition stolen. This was soon followed by another message that the
            murderers were seen walking the railroad tracks towards <a href="#southbend">South Bend</a>. Immediately a posse of twenty-five civilians and a squad
            of militia under command of Lieutenant <a href="#gelhaar">Harry
               Gelhaar</a>, one of the bravest and most daring officers, started out in
            pursuit of the fugitives in a special train. They went to <a href="#northbend">North Bend</a> where the posse was divided. Twelve men
            under Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> crossed the river on hand cars.
            From here they traced the fugitives by tracks in the snow, apparently headed for
            the <a href="#bluntplace">
               <a href="#blunt">Blunt</a> place</a> about four miles to the north.
            The posse arrived at the <a href="#blunt">Blunt</a><i>. (sic) </i> farm and
            surrounded the house. The blinds were drawn and the place appeared to be
            deserted. The posse entered and found a note written by <a href="#gray">Gray</a>, that read: "We have taken your neighbor for a hostage. If
            you do not follow us or report the matter, he will not be harmed." It
            was afterwards learned that the murderers, arrived at the <a href="#blunt">Blunt</a> home about eleven o'clock and demanded breakfast. Mrs. <a href="#msblunt">Blunt</a>, the two-month bride of the <a href="#blunt">young farmer</a>, invited them to sit down and wait while
            she went to the chicken coop for some eggs. <a href="#msblunt">She</a>
            stepped out the back door, going toward the chicken coop, but turned and ran
            towards the nearest farm a mile away and phoned the alarm. It was when she
            failed to return that the fugitives realized that they were in danger. They
            ordered Mr. <a href="#blunt">Blunt</a> to hitch up the team and drive them
            to <a href="#albright">Albright</a>. <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and
            <a href="#morley">Morley</a> went with him to the barn to assist in
            getting the wagon ready, while <a href="#gray">Gray</a> remained in the
            house to write the note. The trio laid down in the bottom of the wagon and with
            the <a href="#blunt">young farmer</a> in the seat high above the party
            started towards the north. They were soon overtaken by the posse and now a
            running fight began. The posse led by Fire Commissioner <a href="#trouton">Trouton</a>, Chief of Police <a href="#briggs">Briggs</a> of South
            Omaha and Sheriffs <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> of <a href="#lancastercounty">Lancaster</a>, and <a href="case">Case</a>
            of <a href="#sarpycounty">Sarpy</a> Counties, kept shooting at the
            murderers. They kept on returning the fire. Suddenly the team came to a
            standstill and <a href="#morley">Morley</a> jumped from the wagon with
            both hands up in the air. Chief <a href="#briggs">Briggs</a> rode up to
            the wagon and looked into it. <q>It is all off"</q> said the chief,
            <q>"they are dead."</q>
            </p>
         
         
         <p>The tragic feature of the running fight was the killing of the young farmer, <a href="#blunt">Roy Blunt</a>. A bullet hole an inch below the endgate of
            the wagon showed the course of the bullet which had embedded itself in his
            heart. The young farmer's friends took the body in charge and laid it tenderly
            in the bottom of the wagon, a horse blanket serving as his shroud. The wagon
            slowly drove back to his farm home, the friends on horseback following it
            quietly and full of grief.</p>

         <h1> CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1>
         
         <h1>HOW THE GUNS GOT IN </h1>
         
         
         <p> Heavy chains and handcuffs were put on <a href="#morley">Morley</a>. He
            told the posse that <a href="blunt">Blunt</a> was the first man to lose
            his life, and that <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a> was the second man
            killed. Their death left <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> and <a href="#morley">Morley</a> alive in the wagon, with the team without a
            driver, racing down the road. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> kept on firing
            at the posse, but <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a>, realizing that the fight was a
            hopeless one, placed his gun at his right temple and killed himself. It was when
            <a href="#morley">Morley</a> looked around and saw that <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> was dead that he jumped out of the wagon, and with
            both hands high in the air, surrendered. He was uninjured, having come through
            the <em>fusilade (sic)</em> without being struck even once. With him
            handcuffed, and the bodies of <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a> and <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a>, the posse drove to <a href="#gretna">Gretna</a> and waited for a special train that had been ordered from <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. Before the train pulled out Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> told the crowd that he would show them the
            captured man and also the dead bodies. <a href="#morley">Morley</a>
            closely guarded was taken to the rear platform, where he stood for a while
            looking at the crowd. The <a href="#hyers">Sheriff</a> asked him to say
            something. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> said: <q>"I am sorry that <a href="#blunt">Roy Blunt</a> was killed."</q> Then the bodies of
            <a href="#gray">Gray</a> and <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a>, ghastly,
            bleeding and awful to look upon, were held limply up to the morbid gaze of the
            crowd. Sheriff <a href="#hyers">Hyers</a> told the crowd that it was he
            who killed <a href="#gray">Gray</a>, and received the cheers of the crowd
            with a pleased smile.</p>
         
         
         <p>News of the capture spread quickly, and large crowds gathered at <a href="#ashland">Ashland</a> and <a href="#waverly">Waverly</a>,
            where the bodies were again exhibited. Two stops were made at <a href="#havelock">Havelock</a>, one at the station and one at the shops,
            and the crowd looked upon the bodies. It became known that a very large crowd
            was at the <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> depot, and it was ordered to run
            the train through without stopping to the <a href="#lancaster">penitentiary</a>. There it stopped at the <i>cross ing (sic) </i>, two
            blocks from the main entrance of the prison. The bodies of the dead desperadoes
            were unloaded and laid by the roadside, while <a href="#morley">Morley</a>
            was taken into the turnkey office. Altogether, he had enjoyed his liberty for
            one hundred hours. He wore a corduroy cap, a duck coat with a fur collar, a
            brown flannel shirt, and heavy' dark trousers. He was again dressed in the
            regulation gray suit, and assigned to a solitary cell in the hole where, with
            <a href="#prince">Prince</a> for a neighbor, he must remain until the
            trial.</p>
         
         
         <p>Soon <a href="lincoln">Lincoln</a>'s popular coroner, Mr. <a href="#matthews">"Jack" Matthews</a>, arrived at the prison. Six
            prisoners were drafted from the east cellhouse to go out and carry in the dead
            bodies. Three of these were lifetimers and had not been outside the prison walls
            for many years. They brought with them a blanket. The body of <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a> was first carried in, and that of <a href="#gray">Gray</a> came second. <a href="#Sgray">Gray</a> was
            unruly even in death, for the body seem inclined to roll off the blanket. It was
            a ghastly sight indeed. The bodies were brought to the chapel and examined by
            Coroner <a href="#matthews">Matthews</a>. He found that <a href="#gray">Gray</a> had been shot with a rifle below the heart. <a href="dowd">Dowd</a> had also only one wound. The bullet had entered the
            right temple and come out the left ear. After the inquest nobody claimed the
            bodies and they were turned over to a medical college. I understand that part of
            <a href="#Shorty_Gray">Shorty Gray</a>'s body is still <q>"in
               pickle"</q> at the college.</p>
         
         
         <p>Visitors at the prison gazing at the bullet holes, usually ask, <q>"but how
               did the guns get in here?"</q> That question still remains unanswered.
            On the evening following the murder, Major <a href="#antles">Antles</a>,
            chief of staff to General <a href="#phelps">Phelps</a>, asked me that same
            question. For an answer, I went into the vaults and brought out the convicts'
            bank ledger and showed him the account of a safeblower. It showed where the man
            had sent two money orders to a woman relative of <a href="#gray">Shorty
               Gray</a>'s living in <a href="lincoln">Lincoln</a>. The account also
            showed<i>. (sic) </i> where <a href="#gray">he</a> had given another
            inmate, a trusty, a check for eight dollars. The first charge, in my opinion,
            represented the money that paid for the guns, and the other, I thought was
            payment for getting them in. The major looked over the accounts carefully and
            asked me several questions. For a while he sat with the book before him, in deep
            study. Then he arose and started for the inside to investigate. Just then there
            came a report that the murderers were located and he had to get out his men and
            start in pursuit of the fugitives. When <a href="#morley">Morley</a> was
            captured the question was put to him and he answered: <q>"There is only one
               man besides me who knows that, and he won't tell."</q> But my theory
            always was, and still is, just as I told Major <a href="#antles">Antles</a>. But it seems to me that the authorities, after getting the

            guns got in.</p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1>
         
         <h1>NEBRASKA'S GREATEST GOVERNOR</h1>
         
         
         <p>All day Friday, <a href="#aldrich">Governor Aldrich</a> was snowbound at
            <a href="#auburn">Auburn</a>. He tried to get to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> by the way of <a href="#fallsCity">Falls
               City</a> but did not succeed. Early Friday morning he called up the <a href="#prison">prison</a> by long distance telephone. I answered the
            phone. I gave the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> all the details about
            the escape, and of the gallant fight of our brave <a href="#warden">warden</a> against such overwhelming odds. <q>It is sad indeed, very
               sad,</q> said the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>. <q>Where were
               you during the fight?</q> he asked me. <q>I was with my <a href="#chief">chief</a>, <a href="#aldrich">Governor</a>; the
               others fled, but I was with him and he died with his right hand in
               mine.</q> Late that night the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>
            managed to get a trxain out of <a href="#auburn">Auburn</a> and together
            with Chairman <a href="#maggi">Maggi</a> of the board of pardons, he
            appeared at the <a href="#prison">prison</a> bright and early Saturday
            morning. He inspected the big <a href="#prison">prison</a> from one end to
            the other and held conferences with the officials and talked with many of the
            guards. He also went into the cell building, went from cell to cell and talked
            with the inmates, and asked how Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>
            had treated them. No one spoke a word against the warden, everyone deplored his
            tragic death and many of them, added: <q>We hope they catch the
               murderers.</q>
            <q>Old Jim was on the square</q> some of them said, and others said:
            <q><a href="#aldrich">Governor</a>, don't think we are all like
               <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a> and his two pals.</q> When
            speaking of the warden, several of these men broke down and cried bitterly. The
            life timers, and the long term men were especially grief-stricken.</p>
         
         <p>The talk with these men convinced the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> more
            than ever that Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> had not been
            cruel to them. During the day he gave out a statement as follows:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I had full confidence in Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>
               and nothing I have found during my investigation at the <a href="#prison">prison</a> has shaken it.</q>

            </div>
         
         <p>I found no general discontent among the prisoners. Any disinterested person
            passing down the line could hear just one sentiment - that of universal regret
            over the untimely fate of the warden and his assistants. It is positively and
            undoubtedly true, as I believe, that the criticisms which have been showered
            upon the penitentiary management were instrumental in rendering discipline at
            the institution less stringent than it would otherwise have been. Some
            safeguards were removed which should have been continued in force. If any proper
            criticism is to be made of Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty's</a>
            administration, it would be that too much leniency was shown the convicts and
            that was probably due in part to his desire not to offend public sentiment, in
            view of the stories which have been published about harsh treatment of the
            men.</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I am convinced that there has been no extreme punishment at the <a href="#prison">prison</a> for the last ten years. So far as general
               methods are concerned, those of Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty's</a> administration are simply a continuance of those
               under former regimes and some of the assistants have been there for fifteen
               and twenty years.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>The <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> also made a long list of
            recommendations, including a reformatory for the first offenders, a separate
            residence for the warden outside the walls, segregation and classification of
            the convicts, enlarged and more modern buildings, an alarm system and up-to-date
            gates and locks. He also announced that he would appoint as warden, a man who
            possesses much executive and administrative ability, who will be firm and yet
            kind.</p>
         
         <p>I always was, and always shall be, a great admirer of Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a>. As a man, he is true, good and sincere; as
            a governor, he worked hard and earnestly for the public welfare; to him
            everybody, rich and poor, looked alike. Notwithstanding the heavy burdens placed
            upon him, burdens heavier than ever placed upon any of our governors before, he
            overcame all obstacles and solved all problems, and gave <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> the best administration it ever had. He will long be
            remembered as a governor for all the people.</p>
         
         <p>The little army of soulsavers that his prison warden refused to feed at the
            expense of the state, were, of course, opposed to the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>, and the lies that they scattered broadcast about the
            atrocities at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>, lost the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> many votes, likewise did the division of
            the Republican party. In one of those landslides that comes every so often, and
            puts a democrat in office, he went down to temporary defeat, to rise again
            before long to a still higher office. He is today the strongest Republican in
            the state. Those who turned against him realize their mistake and regret it.
            Were the elections to be held over again now, he would sweep the country.</p>
         
         <p>In the office of the chief clerk at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>, hangs
            a large picture of Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a>. There were
            also pictures of him on the walls of the other offices, but it was astonishing
            to see how quickly they were taken down. One of the officials, a turncoat, a
            two-faced skate, even sent down to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> for a
            picture of the democratic governor-elect, on the day after election. He got it
            and hung it over his desk. When the democrats came smelling around and were
            telling about what we are going to do when we take possession this man
            used to tell how he had supported Mr. <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a>. He
            managed to hold his fifty dollar job and is at the height of his glory.</p>
         
         <p>But the picture of the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> remained upon the
            walls of my office. When Mr. <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>, the democratic
            warden, took possession he suggested that <q>we take Aldrich down and put
               <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> up.</q> I told him that it was
            not a matter of politics with me but the picture hung there on account of my
            admiration of the governor's personality, and besides, it was a present to me
            from the late Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a>, and for these
            reasons I would like to have the picture hang there as long as I was in office.
            The new warden is a gentleman in every sense of the word, a man who respects the
            feelings of others. He said: <q>Well, that is all right, you keep Governor
               <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a> in your office but I will put up
               Governor <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> in mine.</q></p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
         
         <h1>WARDEN MELICK COMES</h1>
         
         
         <p>Usually when a new governor takes office, there comes from all corners of the
            state a small army of patriots to offer their services to the state. Scores of
            them cast their eyes longingly upon the office of the prison warden and move
            heaven and earth to land that office. But after the assassination of the deputy
            warden, the murder of the warden and the two officials, and the wounding of
            still another, these patriots were noted by their absence. They were not anxious
            at all to expose themselves to the assassin's dagger or the murderer's guns. On
            the seventeenth Governor <a href="#aldrich">Aldrich</a> announced the
            appointment of <a href="#melick">Mr. S. M. Melick</a>, of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, to the office of prison warden. <q>I
               believe that <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a> is competent to
               discharge the duties of the warden,</q> said the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a>, <q>and that he will make a good officer. He is now in
               charge.</q></p>

            <small>This is an image of Warden Melick</small>
            </div>
         
         <p>The president of a national bank in <a href="#gage">Gage</a> county
            appeared to think the same, for he wrote a letter as follows:</p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Please permit me to congratulate the state for securing so competent a man
               for warden of our <a href="#prison">prison</a>, as well as to
               compliment the <a href="#aldrich">governor</a> for his ability in
               securing a five-thousand dollar man for a two-thousand dollar
               position.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p><a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a> has been deputy sheriff and sheriff of
            <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> county, United States marshall, as
            well as chief of police of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> for many years.
            He was known as the most active man that ever held these offices. He is a man of
            fine appearance, large and powerful, and as brave as a lion. To look at him you
            would say that he was a natural born sheriff or warden. He has come in contact
            with hundreds of criminals and knows them;' and they know him, too. He has
            transported some' of the most notorious criminals to and from <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, many of whom were not handcuffed or
            chained, for he dislikes to expose a prisoner to the gaze of the curious. Among
            those that he transported were <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a> and his two
            pals, <a href="#forbes">Forbes</a> and <a href="#evans">Evans</a>.
            Following their capture after blowing the bank at <a href="#giltner">Giltner</a>, and fearing that their friends might rescue them, the
            authorities at <a href="#aurora">Aurora</a> decided to place them in the
            penitentiary for safe keeping. Colonel <a href="#melick">Melick</a>,
            representing the Nebraska Bankers Association, went to take them to <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. The robbers were unknown to the officers at
            <a href="#aurora">Aurora</a>, but when <a href="#melick">Mr.
               Melick</a> walked into the jail he recognized in one of them an old time
            acquaintance, <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a>. Several years ago <a href="#gray">Shorty</a> had been arrested by <a href="#melick">Mr.
               Melick</a> and had remained as his guest for some weeks at the county
            jail. <q>Pretty tough luck, <a href="#gray">Shorty</a>,</q> was <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick's</a> greeting to his former charge.
            <q>Darned tough luck, <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a>,</q> said
            <a href="#gray">Shorty</a>. Large crowds gathered at the station along
            the line to see the bank robbers, but <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a>
            took them back into the Pullman and pulled down the curtains, and thus kept them
            from the gaze of the curious throngs. This shows the humanity of the man. The
            dynamiters showed their appreciation by acting like men and making no trouble of
            any kind. Upon their arrival in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> they were
            hurried into a large automobile and quickly landed behind the gray walls of <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>. When the convicts heard of the
            appointment of <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a> they were curious to know
            all about him. Way up on gallery C sat an old fellow who was serving from one to
            ten years for burglary. <q>I know him well,</q> said this old burglar,
            <q>for he brought me from <a href="#sacramento">Sacramento</a> to
               <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> once. I laid up in that jail a long
               time trying to beat the case, and believe me, that he was a feeder.</q>
            For the benefit of those of my readers who are unfamiliar with the criminal
            vocabulary, I will explain, that the criminals rate the sheriffs in two classes.
            One class are the <q>feeders,</q> and the other class are the
            <q>stomach robbers.</q> The first feed well, but the others
            instead of giving the prisoners sufficient to eats draw the money from the
            county and divert the most of it to their own benefit. News travels fast in the
            <a href="#prison">penitentiary</a>, although they are not permitted to
            talk from cell to cell, yet their exists a kind of mental telepathy or a
            wireless, telegraph system in there. Before long it was known in every cell what
            the old burglar had said. Thus before taking charge, the new warden had the good
            will of the boys in gray, and they anxiously looked forward to his coming.</p>
         
         <p>He came, and accompanied by Chairman <a href="#maggi">Maggi</a> of the
            pardon board, called on the inmates right away. From cell to cell he went and
            shook hands with the prisoners. He talked with them freely, and many of them
            told him of their troubles. He listened to all they had to say, and it seemed as
            if he inspired hope in their hearts. Many of the boys told him that they
            deplored Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty's</a> tragic death, and
            that they were not in sympnthy (sic) with the murderers. Several of the boys
            knew the warden and expressed pleasure at seeing him. He told them all that he
            wanted to treat them on the square, and that he expected the square deal in
            return. All assured him that they would do right and act like men. The next step
            for the new warden to take was to meet the officials and guards. These he
            weighed, and found many of them wanting. For instance, three were paralyzed,
            three others were cripples, and some were too old to be of any service - several
            were drunkards. These were given their checks, as was Turnkey <a href="#pahl">Claus Pahl</a>, who in the hour of trouble, turned the keys
            of the <a href="#prison">prison</a> over to the desperadoes and then went
            into hiding in the cellar. The turnkey post is an important one. He must be a
            strong, sober man possessing good judgment, and one who can be depended on in
            case of an outbreak. It took several days to find such a man. In the meantime
            Colonel <a href="#branson">C. M. Branson</a>, one out of several business
            men who came forward to lend a hand in the hour of trouble, took charge of the
            keys. The board of public lands and buildings held a meeting, and it was decided
            to increase the pay of the guards to fifty dollars a month. Previously the pay
            had been only thirty dollars a month. No wonder that the <a href="#prison">penitentiary</a> became a clearing house for human derelicts, for only
            such would work for such a small wage. The board also permitted the warden to
            make additional expenditures for better food. On the second day the new warden
            went over the books carefully and looked over the expenditures of the <a href="#prison">prison</a>. He read the report of former Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a>, who estimated a deficiency of about ten
            thousand dollars in the maintenance fund, which, together with the now increased
            salaries and unforeseen expenses on account of the outbreak, he foresaw would go
            much higher. He realized that he must watch every expenditure and save every
            penny that possibly could be saved. He paid much attention to the coal and meat
            bills and set out to watch these from the start. He found the bookkeeping method
            unsatisfactory, and demanded a daily balance sheet of each fund that he might
            tell at any time the exact financial condition of the <a href="#prison">prison</a>. In order to get started off right he called for the state
            auditor to audit the books. Mr. <a href="#tufleys">J. W. Tufleys</a>,
            expert accountant for the state, came over and gave them a thorough examination.
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> felt that he could master the
            situation thoroughly so the militia was now withdrawn. The cells were opened,
            and after nearly two weeks of confinement the men marched again together to the
            dining room. One by one the shops started in to operate and soon everything
            assumed its usual appearance. The warden, who knew from experience that in order
            to work a man must be fed, had engaged Mr. <a href="#walsh">Andrew C.
               Walsh</a>, a practical and experienced man, for dining room
            superintendent. Mr. <a href="#walsh">Walsh</a> was chef for a while for
            the officers in command of our army in the <a href="#philippines">Philippines</a>, and is as good a chef as he is a brave soldier. He
            possesses three medals for bravery while fighting in the <a href="#philippines">Philippines</a>. Under him the dining room
            progressed as it never did before. Much better food was served. Mr. <a href="#walsh">Wals</a> saw that it was thoroughly prepared and seasoned,
            and absolutely clean. Hitherto all the food was cooked by steam. The warden,
            knowing how quickly the human stomach tires of steam cooked food, installed a
            large kitchen range, that the boys might be served with fried meats and
            potatoes. I wish my reader could have seen the look on the faces of those
            prisoners one evening when they walked in and sat down to a supper of fried meat
            and fried potatoes. They were more than pleased, for hitherto the potatoes had
            been served with the jackets on and many of them were not thoroughly cooked.
            From now on the potatoes were served in many styles: browned, German and French
            fried, and potato cakes. Many new dishes, never before served were now added to
            the bill of fare. Vegetables were served in abundance, and once in a while
            fruit. It is a fact that these boys were better fed than half of the laboring
            men in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>; and the old saying that the way
            to a man's heart is via his stomach manifested itself, for the boys
            behaved splendidly and were anxious to show the warden that they appreciated his
            kindness.</p>
         
         <p>The <a href="#prison">prison</a> had a band of seven pieces, equipped with
            old, delapidated (sic) instruments. This band <a href="#melick">Mr.
               Melick</a> set out to reorganize and enlarge; but alas, there were no
            funds for such a purpose. Many of the inmates came forward and joined the band
            and bought their own instruments. A collection was taken up among the inmates,
            friends of the prisoners, the warden contributed more and the band went in debt
            for still more. The band, by this time was christened The Melick Concert
            Band, in honor of its originator. It consisted of twenty-two men
            equipped with the very best and most up-to-date instruments and became as
            popular as any band in the state. The members were clad in snow-white uniforms
            during the summer months, and cadet blue uniforms trimmed with broad black
            braid, during the winter months. During the State Fair week, when over thirteen
            thousand people visited the <a href="#prison">prison</a>, it attracted
            much attention. Many favorable comments were passed, and small coins, to the
            amount of three hundred and twenty-five dollars, were dropped into the
            contribution box. From this fund the debts of the band were paid and many new
            instruments and music purchased.</p>
         
         <p>Now came another surprise for the inmates. As they walked into the dining room
            one evening, there was the band to play for them during the evening meal. The
            boys were delighted, and indeed they had reason to be, for no other hotel in
            <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> furnished such splendid table music.
            From that day on, and all during Warden <a href="#melick">Melick's</a>
            administration, the band played during the evening meal. The warden codsidered
            (sic) music one of the foremost factors in maintaining prison discipline, a
            factor more beneficial than anything else. During his tenure, music became one
            of the most predominating features of the life at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>.</p>
         
         <p>Following the outbreak, all newspapers containing any news about the murder were
            confiscated and not sent inside to the prisoners. The inmates are great readers
            and subscribe for the dailies and weeklies published in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. In addition, they received by every mail about one hundred
            and fifty metropolitan and county newspapers, and many magazines. The boys were
            longing for news from the outside world and were delighted when Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> raised the ban upon the papers. There are
            prisons where newspapers are contraband at any time and are as carefully
            excluded as are opium and morphine. Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>
            was not in favor of this system. On the contrary, he felt that the newspapers
            were of benefit to him, and he thought that what was beneficial to him ought not
            to seriously injure his men. Not even the yellow journals were excluded, nor
            were their associate muck rakers, the magazines, kept from coming in. The warden
            thought that even these do a world of good in uncovering frauds and wrongs in
            high places, and in driving powerful wrongdoers to cover; and when their work is
            completed, the smaller will not have the example of those higher up in life to
            justify them in crime. He felt that the desire for these papers was better than
            no desire at all, that when the prisoners read these their mind was occupied,
            and that the time passed so much quicker for them. Not only to the inmates did
            the warden consider the newspapers of immeasurable value, as mighty factors in
            maintaining discipline, but to the institution as well. The prisoners received
            his order for unrestricted entrance into the <a href="#prison">prison</a>,
            of all newspapers and periodicals, with much pleasure. An unrestricted mail was
            another feature that Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> permitted that
            aided him much in his work. While the prisoners were formerly permitted to write
            only one letter a week, they were now permitted to write special ones and to
            receive as many as the letter carrier brought. Good books the warden also
            considered a great factor in maintaining the prison discipline, as well as great
            educational factors. The library was thoroughly overhauled and cleaned, the
            books were classified and listed, and many scientific and practical handbooks
            were added; books that teach men to do things in life - how to build houses, how
            to run machinery, how to mix concrete, books on electricity and many other
            practical books that benefit and strengthen the readers and fit them to better
            cope with the practical bread-and-butter part of life, when the big steel gate
            swings open to them. To those who prefer fiction, it is there in abundance.
            Hitherto the rule had been to allow one book to each inmate per week, but now
            this rule was changed, and if a book was finished before the week was up,
            another one was brought in its place; thus the men were never with out good
            reading. The reorganized library consisted of books as follows:</p>

         <p>In addition to these books, subscriptions were placed for all the leading
            magazines and many trade papers. Hundreds of magazines were also donated by
            private individuals, and many periodicals were sent to the <a href="#prison">prison</a> by Assistant Postmaster <a href="#ludlam">Ludlam</a> of
            <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. These were the uncalled for
            periodicals.</p>
         
         <p>Instead of destroying them they were sent to <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> and distributed among the inmates, read and re-read, and
            gave the boys much pleasure. Everything that would elevate and educate the human
            mind found favor with Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>. Several of the
            inmates took correspondence courses in law, pharmacy, electricity and
            engineering, and went out well qualified to fill good positions. Theatricals
            were given at intervals, a stringed orchestra and several quartettes were
            organized, and new members were added to the choir which was as good as many a
            choir in the fashionable churches in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>.
            Baseball and football became favorite sports with the boys, but the <a href="#prison">prison</a> is sadly in need of a park for outdoor sports.
            School was held in the evenings under the direction of Chaplain <a href="#harmon">Harmon</a>, assisted by six of the better educated
            inmates. Many a man came in illiterate and went out able to read and write,
            while others improved most wonderfully. Many lecturers were secured by <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a>, some of national reputation. On June the
            second, 1912, William J. Bryan delivered his famous lecture The Making of a
            Man. Other lecturers were <a href="#metcalf">Governor Metcalf</a>,
            Doctor Bixby, William Maupin, Chief Justice Reese, Attorney Wolfenbarger,
            Colonel Presson, Mrs. Bessie Gerhart Morrison, Mrs. Leila English and Miss
            Richardson, known froth coast to coast as the flag lady, Rev. F. L.
            Wharton of Pittsburg, Senator Burkett, Mrs. Jackson, President of the W. C. T.
            U., Mr. C. T. Bowers, Mr. F. E. Linch and many others.</p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
         
         <h1>THE WORD OF AN OUTCAST</h1>
         
         
         <p>Is there such a thing as honor among thieves? Indeed there is. Charles Reade in
            his famous book, It is Never Too Late to Mend, speaks of a little girl
            who came to see a thief just captured. Oh dear, she said, I couldn't
            have told it from a man. And a thief, although a thief, is still a man.
            Overlooking the blunder that he has made; like any other man, he is sure to have
            honor within his heart. Well, who will believe a convicted felon? Who will
            believe in his word of honor? Read a little further into this chapter and you
            will know.</p>
         
         <p>Everything moved along nicely at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>. The
            boys had plenty of good and well prepared food; they had much music, many
            entertainments, and plenty of good reading matter. Hearth that formerly were
            filled with despair were now full of hope. Faces that used to look sad and
            gloomy were now smiling. All the way through the, boys were happy, in good
            spirits, and turning out more work than ever before. There was never even a
            semblance of a riot after Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> took charge;
            and I believe that if one had been attempted, ninety-seven per cent of the
            inmates would have aided in putting it down. <q>There won't be an outbreak as
               long as <a href="#melick">Mr. Melick</a> is warden,</q> said a long
            time safe: blower to me. <q>The boys appreciate what he is doing for them,
               and will not impose upon him.</q> And now came the honor system,
            something unknown in the <a href="#prison">Nebraska prison</a> but applied
            in a few other prisons. Credit should be given to <a href="#tynan">Thomas J.
               Tynan</a>, warden of the <a href="#colorado">Colorado</a> prison,
            for being the first to use this method. Like the <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> warden, he feels that the prisoners are human beings and
            will respond to human treatment the same as other humans. The methods of Warden
            <a href="#tynan">Tynan</a>, of sending men unguarded to the road
            camps, which were also unguarded, are known the world over.</p>
         
         <p>Other wardens such as <a href="#arizona">Robert B. Sims</a>, of <a href="#arizona">Arizona</a> penitentiary, Warden <a href="#sanders">Sanders</a> of <a href="#iowa">Iowa</a> penitentiary, and Warden
            <a href="#codding">Codding</a> of <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a>
            prison, have applied the honor system with much success. Governor <a href="#west">West</a> of <a href="#oregon">Oregon</a> takes a
            great interest in prison work, and the honor system is now used at the <a href="#oregon">Oregon</a> prison. From far away <a href="#hawaii">Hawaii</a>, Governor <a href="#frear">Frear</a> has just sent his
            private secretary, Mr. <a href="#courtney">Norman Courtney</a>, to
            investigate the methods used at the <a href="#oregon">Oregon</a> prison,
            with the result that before long the honor system will be introduced throughout
            the <a href="#hawaii">Hawaiian Islands</a>. Warden <a href="#homer">William J. Homer</a> of <a href="#greatmeadowsprison">Great Meadows
               Prison</a> at <a href="#comstock">Comstock</a>, <a href="#newyork">New York</a>, must also be added to this list. He has
            recently taken charge of the sixty mutinous convicts from <a href="#singsing">Sing Sing</a>, has put them on their honor and they are
            doing nicely. There were several idle men at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>, and the farmers were clamoring for men. The <a href="#prison">prison</a> planted a larger area in vegetables than ever
            before and a larger force of men went to work there. Several men were out
            singlehanded to work on the farms, while others went in gangs, some with and
            some without guards. Before selecting a man for farm work the warden called the
            man to his office and talked with him for a while. He asked him if he would give
            him his word of honor not to escape, and explained to him that to be a trusty
            was a stepping stone to a parole and final release; while on the other hand to
            escape meant to forfeit his good time when recaptured. Altogether this honor
            system was a success During the harvest months these trusties earned nearly five
            hundred dollars for the state, quite a sum of money for themselves, besides
            being out in the open and enjoying their liberty.</p>
         
         <p>The boys in gray possess honor as well as the men on the outside, which is shown
            in the case of an inmate serving from one to twenty years. When he heard that
            his father lay dead out in his little home town in the western part of the
            state, he went to Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> and, with tears in
            his eyes, pleaded that he be permitted to attend the last rites over the body.
            For quite a while he and the warden talked, it over.</p>
         
         <p><q>And do you give me your word of honor that you will return by
               Friday?</q> asked the warden. <q>I do,</q> said the prisoner. He
            went, and on Friday, true to his word, the word of an outcast, walked into the
            office of the warden and delivered himself up. While on the way to the funeral,
            as the familiar scenes flashed by, he must have bitterly thought of the irony of
            fate. A free man for the time being, because of the death of one who was near
            and dear to him. At the services he must have seen a smirk in the smile of his
            old neighbors. The stares of his former friends must have been hateful to his
            sight. After it was all over, after he had bid his wife and babies a tender
            farewell, he must return to a long life of disgrace and solitude. Why not leave
            the train at one of the stops and flee for his liberty? Why pay the heavy toll
            which society demanded? He could soon be in another state where, under another
            name, he could begin life anew. But the promise given to Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, which was the only link that held him on the
            return journey, proved stronger than all the chains in the world. The twilight
            found him again behind those gray stone walls of <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> that surround hundreds of other aching hearts.</p>
         
         <p>This man was, to all appearances, an innocent man, one of the several that serve
            at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> for a crime committed by somebody
            else. He afterwards became the warden's coYachman, and later on worked around my
            office. It was while filling these positions of trust that he managed to prove
            his innocence and was sent home.</p>
         
         <p>I recall a similar case. The superintendent of the state hospital at <a href="#kearney">Kearney</a> wired Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> that their chef had been taken ill, and asked him for the loan
            of one for a few weeks. The warden sent for a young man working in the guard's
            kitchen, and asked him if he would like to make the trip. He was much surprised,
            and gave the warden his word of honor that he would do right. The following day
            his mother came to visit him, and she was also much surprised. She thanked
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, and said that she did not know how to
            repay him. <q>Madam,</q> said the warden, <q>you can repay me by
               writing your son a letter telling him to be true to his word.</q> She
            did, but it was not necessary, for about a week later this young man,
            unannounced, walked into the Warden's office. There was a happy look on his
            face. He told the warden that the chef had returned to his post and his work
            gave out, therefore he came back. The warden shook hands with him and said:
            <q>You have acted like a man.</q> He soon became the warden's chef and
            admitted to parole. Now and then I get a letter from him. He is in South <a href="#omaha">Omaha</a>, is saving his money, and is in every way a
            model citizen. I also recall the case of <a href="#bwilliams">Billy
               Williams</a>, an expert boilermaker who was serving a long sentence. At
            the time the new boilers and stokers were installed, he was put in charge of the
            installation. Besides the value of his labor, he saved the state hundreds of
            dollars by his valuable suggestions. He was also sent to the hospital at <a href="#kearney">Kearney</a> and went unattended. He gave good
            satisfaction there. For his efficient and faithful service, Mrs. <a href="#barker">Barker</a>, the superintendent of the hospital, wrote
            several letters to the board of pardons, asking them to act favorably in his
            case. While at <a href="#kearney">Kearney</a> he made friends with several
            of the leading men of that town, who added the weight of their word to the
            application for a pardon. Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> also
            appeared before the board in his behalf, and finally a pardon was granted. He
            located in <a href="#colorado">Colorado</a>, opened a shop of his own and
            prospered.</p>
         
         <p>When <a href="#bwilliams">Williams</a> was pardoned the hospital at <a href="#kearney">Kearney</a> needed another man and <a href="#martindale">Frank Martindale</a> was sent over there. <a href="#martindale">Martindale</a> was assistant to the master mechanic
            of the <a href="#prison">prison</a> and one of the handiest men with tools
            that I ever saw. Once a small private safe of my own refused to open, and after
            working on it for a long time I sent for <a href="#martindale">Martindale</a>. He looked at the lock for a few minutes, went out for a
            wire and quickly opened the safe. We disliked to let him go, but he deserved it.
            He, too went without a guard, and worked hard and faithfully. About a month
            alter going to <a href="#kearney">Kearney</a>, he asked permission to go
            to the bedside of his dying mother who lived in an adjoining state. He was
            granted permission; again he made a long journey without a guard. <q>That is
               the last you will ever see of <a href="#martindale">Martindale</a>,</q> said one of the guards. But on the day set for his
            return, in walked <a href="#martindale">Martindale</a>. He told the warden
            that his mother was getting better. I told him what the guard had said, and said
            that I was glad to see him live up to his promise. He answered that he would
            rather lose his right arm than break his word to Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>. He was later paroled, became a contractor and builder, and
            now has several men working for him.</p>
         
         <p>That a prisoner working out on a farm should ask to come back to the <a href="#prison">prison</a> seems strange, but it has happened. On an
            August day a paroled prisoner asked Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> if
            he could come back <q>home.</q> The <a href="#prison">prison</a>
            fare, he told Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, is many times better
            than the food served on the farm. Especially he longed for one of those Sunday
            dinners. He was given permission to come <q>home,</q> was put to
            work in the <a href="#prison">prison</a> garden for a few days, then a
            better place was found for him on a dairy farm where he worked until his
            sentence expired. He came to the <a href="#prison">prison</a> to bid us
            good-bye, dressed in a tailor made suit, had a ticket for his old home in <a href="#michigan">Michigan</a> and about sixty dollars in money. <q>I
               am going home to my old mother in <a href="#michigan">Michigan</a>,
               and I am going to stay there.</q></p>
         
         <p>He afterwards wrote me a letter stating that he was getting along nicely, was
            owner of a fine big team and a transfer business. He also wrote that as long as
            he lived, he will never forget Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> and the
            kind treatment received at his hands. He tells me how it caused him to undergo a
            change for the better and made him again a man.</p>
         
         <p>I could state many similar cases but space does not permit. Taken as a whole,
            Warden <a href="#melick">Melick's</a> honor system was a success from the
            start and well worth adopting in every prison throughout the land. Several
            wardens have come forward and given it a trial. As this book goes to press, we
            learn of Warden <a href="#allen">Allen</a> of the <a href="#jolietpenitentiary"><a href="#joliet">Joliet</a>
               penitentiary</a> starting out a gang of men on honor to do road work. From
            all over the country and from many metropolitan papers came requests for
            information as to the methods he used to bring about his success. The answer
            was: Give the boys plenty of good food, clean, and well prepared; give them
            work, but do not overwork them; and above all things, treat them like
            men. Several clubs and societies in this and other states have invited
            him to attend banquets and meetings to speak on the <q>honor
               system.</q> He replied most courteously, but regretted that time did
            not permit him to attend. He felt that he was being paid by the state of <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a> for running the <a href="#prison">penitentiary</a>, and that was a duty that he could not attend to at a
            distance.</p>

         <h1>HELL ABANDONED</h1>
         
         
         <p>There must be discipline among the officers and guards as well as among the
            inmates. Formerly the recommendation of some high politican (sic) was sufficient
            to get a position at the pen. But the board of public lands and buildings had
            sanctioned increased salaries and the employment of more men; and while it
            became an unpleasant task for Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> to
            discharge the old and crippled guards, safety and precaution demanded it, and
            they were replaced with younger and more active men, better qualified for the
            service. According to the warden's ideas a prison officer must be a man of high
            character, fairly well educated and a judge of humanity. He must obey orders
            from his superiors, likewise the inmates must obey him. He should be a man of
            good appearance, kind but firm and thoroughly schooled in self control.</p>
         
         <p>As Napoleon rode at the head of his armies through <a href="#egypt">Egypt</a> past the pyramids, he halted and said: Soldiers, from the
            summit of these pyramids, forty centuries look down upon you. And the
            warden, within his castled home at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>
            called each new officer before him and discussed prison discipline with him,
            gave him his instructions and pointed out to him that from those depths of crime
            and despair nearly four hundred unfortunates look up to him for example and
            guidance, and that he should not let them look in vain.</p>
         
         <p>But to reorganize a prison takes time. All the employees cannot be dismissed at
            the same time and replaced with new men, for that would be unsafe and flirting
            with an outbreak. A new deputy warden, Major <a href="#antles">H. H.
               Antles</a> had been appointed, and a new office created, that of assistant
            deputy warden. Mr. <a href="#burke">John Burke</a>, a guard, was appointed
            to the office. The warden gave orders that the south door leading from the
            chapel into</p>
         
         <div>
            <img src="pg 325 ch 36.png"></img>
            <small>This is an image of Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, Deputy
               Warden <a href="#kavanaugh">Kavanaugh</a>, <a href="#morley">Morley</a>, and Sheriff <a href="#daly">Daly</a></small>
            </div>
         
         <p>the yard must be locked at all times, and only one inmate admitted to the chapel
            at a time. Had this rule been in force on the day of the murder, only one of the
            desperadoes could have gotten into the chapel, and perhaps they would have
            chosen some other route. The reason that they were open on that day was not due
            to negligence on anyone's part, but because that by keeping the door open the
            salary of the chapel turnkey could be saved. Such an officer was now appointed;
            and Mr. <a href="#cavanaro">A. Cavanaro</a> of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> was chosen to fill the office. Mr. <a href="#cavanaro">Cavanaro</a> is a gentleman of high education, has traveled extensively,
            and is well fitted for that kinds of work. An assistant yardmaster, Mr. <a href="#gross">Roy Gross</a>, and an assistant farm superintendent, Mr.
            <a href="#seuferlein">George Seuferlein</a>, both of whom favored
            strict discipline and yet were kind and humane, were added to the force. Mr.
            <a href="#moore">Oscar Moore</a>, for many years a prison official and
            a man of humanity and efficiency, was given charge of the <a href="#prison">prison</a> cell buildings at night, and they became more quiet than ever
            before. Of the new guards appointed, I wish to mention Mr. <a href="#johnson">Arthur Johnson</a>, a good man and a good prison man as
            well. <a href="#kavanaugh">Mr. D. G. Kavanaugh</a>, a former prison
            official, was also called back, and took charge of the men in the chair shops.
            He is a strong democrat. In a race for sheriff of <a href="#saunders">Saunders county</a>, a republican stronghold, he came within a dozen
            votes of his republican rival, Mr. <a href="#daly">Daly</a>. Elsewhere in
            this book is shown a picture of <a href="#kavanaugh">Mr. Kavanaugh</a> and
            Mr. <a href="#daly">Daly</a>, taken on the courthouse steps at <a href="#wahoo">Wahoo</a>. But politics were not a factor in this matter.
            <a href="#kavanaugh">Mr. Kavanaugh's</a> record as an efficient prison
            man is what brought him back. Again he proved successful. His friends were
            pleased to learn of his appointment as assistant deputy warden by Mr. <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>. Then there were Mr. <a href="#price">D.
               E. Price</a>, of <a href="#phillips">Phillips</a>, Mr. <a href="#thompson">C. Thompson</a>, Mr. <a href="#griffin">J. M.
               Griffin</a>, of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, and Mr. <a href="#johnson">L. E. Johnson</a>, of <a href="#raymond">Raymond</a>, all new' officers who proved themselves very successful in
            the handling of the inmates, and by kindness and humanity got back more work out
            of them than did their predecessors. Mr. <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a>
            afterwards succeeded Mr. <a href="#walsh">Walsh</a> as dining room
            superintendent, and kept the dining room and kitchen as clean as a pin. An
            assistant physician was added that the men could have medical attention at any
            time, day or night. This office was filled by Doctor <a href="#gifford">M.
               Gifford Welch</a>, who worked hard to save the wounded prison officials.
            He was later on succeeded by Doctor Ward Hedlund, of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. This competent doctor made a great success, especially at
            surgery. He was on the job early and late and made a fine record. He left for
            the western part of the state to practise (sic) medicine. He was succeeded by
            Doctor <a href="#humphrey">H. H. Humphrey</a>, of Western, who also made
            quite a reputation as a surgeon. Of the guards already in the service, <a href="#berry">Mr. Charles Berry</a> was retained. Mr. <a href="#berry">Berry</a> has for years been in charge of Factory
            C, and has not reported any inmates for punishment for many years.
            Mr. <a href="#berry">Berry</a> runs his factory by the golden rule
            principle, and the men in return treat him on the square.</p>
         
         <p>Taken as a whole, Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> had a good force of
            men; but everywhere in any institution, in any lodge or church, you will find
            once in a while a scalawag. Even the garden of paradise has its snakes; likewise
            did the big <a href="#prison">prison</a> at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>, for some of the old guards were not in sympathy with the
            warden's methods of treating the inmates like men. There is no doubt in my mind
            that Major <a href="#antles">Antles</a>, the new deputy warden, was a
            brave and daring soldier, who while I was sitting in my little room discussing
            our war with <a href="#spain">Spain</a>, he was in the jungles of <a href="#cuba">Cuba</a>, ready to fight to uphold the honor of the
            greatest flag in the world. Major <a href="#antles">Antles</a> looked upon
            an inmate as a man who seldom, very seldom reforms, while the warden believed
            that while not all reform, that the average convict does, and that still more
            would reform if modern methods were employed and better facilities for
            individual treatment were at hand.</p>
         
         <p>Hitherto the deputy warden and his assistant had been in charge of the
            punishment. From time to time came complaints to the warden of unjust
            punishments or such as were unnecessary, where a reprimand or a good heart to
            heart talk would have accomplished more. Finally there appeared in the <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> Daily News of August 29; 1912, an
            article criticising (sic) the deputy warden for stringing up men for not
            saluting him when he walked through a factory. Again on September 3, 1912,
            appeared another article of the same kind, stating that inmates <a href="#ross">Ross</a> and <a href="#howard">Howard</a> had been
            strung up for failure to stand at attention while the deputy warden
            walked through Factory C. Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>
            called on the deputy for an explanation.</p>
         
         <p>He also gave orders that in the future no officer or guard be permitted to punish
            an inmate - that all punishment were to come under his own supervision. There
            being always two sides to a story, the warden not only heard the guard's
            complaints but the story of the prisoner as well. This was something new to the
            old guards. Usually a good heart to heart talk between the warden and the sinner
            set everything right and, he went away with hope in his heart to sin no more.
            Another rule went into effect at the same time. Any inmate was permitted, on
            application, to appear before the warden in the evening and state to him any
            grievance or any ill-treatment that he had received, or to talk over any
            business matter or talk about his case. The warden took all these matters under
            careful consideration and gave them his best attention. Everybody was happy and
            taking it as a whole, the officers and guards were well satisfied and so were
            the inmates. The relations between them and Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> had become not like that of a keeper - I mean a watchman,
            whose prime duty it is to stand on guard to keep them from getting out - but
            that of a good true friend. At the same time, these inmates were not a special
            run of men, but just ordinary men, the same as you find in those prisons that
            within the past months have become notorious for mutiny and revolt. The warden
            did not happen to be of the ordinary run of wardens. He was a man of sufficient
            moral weight to hold under easy control those he was sent out to govern, and
            only in the rarest instances was his confidence abused. In such cases the
            offender was punished only by taking away his privileges to receive visitors, to
            receive tobacco and to write letters.</p>
         
         <p>On September the sixth, the warden took into his personal charge the keys to the
            hole; and except as to serve as a place for the keeping of condemned men, Hell
            was Abandoned.</p>
         
         <p>I have told my reader of several instances where the warden depended upon the
            word of an outcast, and I could tell you of scores of others who lived up to
            their word; but there is an exception to most rules and also to this one. There
            were altogether ten escapes during Warden <a href="#melick">Melick's</a>
            administration, all of whom were yardmen or gardeners; nobody sawed their way
            out. Of these, ten, five were recaptured the same day, and five were never
            recovered although we have a line on two of them. <a href="#melick">Mr.
               Melick</a> also recovered one prisoner, who escaped during another
            administration, and located two more serving time in other penitentiaries. One
            of those who escaped and was recovered, was a young man, a relative of <a href="#morley">Morley</a>, who had just been refused a parole and was
            also an escape from a <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a> prison. It was unknown
            to the warden that this boy had been placed on the outside of the walls as a
            trusty, and the assistant deputy warden was blamed for having done it; but while
            the assistant deputy warden blundered, the deputy, who knew the boy's record, as
            well as knew that he was wanted in <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a>, should
            have ordered him back within the walls. With no hope whatever, with many years
            in prison staring him in the face, you could hardly blame the boy for running
            away. Perhaps you, my reader, would have done likewise; but you can rightfully
            blame the officers who put him on the outside as well as the superior officer
            who sanctioned it. If he had escaped, what would the <a href="#kansas">Kansas</a> prison officials have said? Could you blame them for thinking
            that the escape was a frame-up and that someone was getting a piece of
            money for it?</p>
         
         <p>Again, when at his desk one afternoon, Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>
            saw a lifetime safeblower, one of the most notorious men behind the walls, a
            desperate man and a <q>dope</q> fiend, working on the outside
            shoveling coal. He immediately turned him in. I wonder what the Nebraska Bankers
            Association would have said had this man escaped, for Mr. <a href="#johnson">Johnson</a> had spent much time and money tracing him from place to
            place. From that day a rule went into effect that no man was to be taken outside
            of the <a href="#prison">prison</a> walls, not even for a few minutes,
            without permission of the warden; consequently there were no more escapes.</p>
         
         <p>During the first week in May, 1912, came the trial of <a href="#morley">Morley</a>, and he having no funds wherewith to employ an attorney, Judge
            <a href="#stewart">Stewart</a> appointed Mr. <a href="#frampton">W. C. Frampton</a> to defend him. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> was
            tried on May 4, 1912. At noon on the following Monday the judge notified the
            court that they had rendered a verdict. The <a href="#prison">prison</a>
            was notified, <a href="#morley">Morley</a> handcuffed to Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, and accompanied by Mr. <a href="#candless">S. A. McCandless</a>, arrived at the court house. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> walked in briskly, holding himself erect.
            While waiting for Judge <a href="#stewart">Stewart</a> to arrive he was
            calm but showed some evidence of nervousness by drumming with his fingers on the
            back of the chair. He talked with several men around the courtroom, and said to
            one: <q>&gt;Well, I wonder what it will be.</q>
            <q>Cheer up,</q> said one, <q>I don't think they will order you a black
               suit.</q>
            <q>Or a rope,</q> said <a href="#morley">Morley</a>, and smiled
            nervously. When the mother arrived at the court house, she asked permission of
            the warden to see her son. She spoke a few words of encouragement to him. Tears
            came into his eyes as she left, and he was silent for a long time.
            Notwithstanding the fact that he was waiting to learn whether he was to live or
            die, <a href="#morley">Morley</a> was able to joke. In reply to a
            question, he said that he slept well the night before and had enjoyed his meals
            yesterday. <q>Do they allow you to play cards out there?</q> asked
            Attorney <a href="#frampton">Frampton</a>. <q>No they don't,</q>
            said <a href="#morley">Morley</a>, <q>but anyway, I have enough of
               solitary, it is getting monotonous.</q> During the time of waiting the
            talk turned to the escape and chase of the murderers in <a href="#sarpy">Sarpy County</a>. <a href="#morley">Morley</a> said that <a href="#gray">Shorty Gray</a> had blown the door lock off with cotton
            soaked in nitro-glycerine. He said that they had a considerable quantity of this
            cotton and threw it away at the end of the chase. <q>Didn't you see a package
               tied up in a handkerchief hanging on a bush at the side of the road near
               where the fight ended? That was the cotton which we put there because we
               were afraid it might get hit by a bullet and blow us up.</q> Turning to a
            <q>Star</q> reporter who had been in the chase, he asked:
            <q>Do you know who got my little '38,' that I carried that day? If we had
               that I could show that I did not break my gun while we were in the chapel.
               <a href="#doody">Doody</a> and <a href="#henry">Red
                  Henry</a> say that I broke the gun and reloaded it. The gun that I had
               was a Colt, one of those that won't eject the shells.</q> He smiled again
            when one of the men asked him about the speeches he made from the rear end of
            the train which brought him and his dead companions back from <a href="#gretna">Gretna</a>. <q>You can sure say that you
               have</q></p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>
         
         <h1> THEIR BEST FRIEND</h1>
         
         
         <p><a href="#morley">Morley</a> was put to work in the chair factory and was a
            model prisoner. Formerly he had enjoyed all the notoriety that he was getting,
            but now he seemed to shun it. I remember on several occasions when I took
            visitors through the <a href="#prison">prison</a> that he either turned
            away or held a newspaper up before his face to protect him from the stares of
            the curious.</p>
         
         <p>I recall a case of a large negro who had the reputation of being the toughest
            negro in the pen. On a cold December day this man went on the warpath out in the
            yard and refused to go to the hole. Three guards were closing in upon him, one
            armed with a piece of lead pipe. The negro backed -up against the wall and was
            ready to fight the three of them when Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>
            came along and ordered the guards to stand back. Putting his hand upon the
            negro's shoulder he said, <q>My boy, you are not going to get struck by that
               pipe as long as I am in charge.</q> The guard dropped the pipe and the
            three slunk away like beaten curs. The warden and the negro had a heart to heart
            talk; soon the tears came trickling down his face. For four years the poor
            fellow had been behind the <a href="#prison">prison</a> walls and had
            seven more to serve, all the time proclaiming his innocence. In all those long
            years no one ever spoke a word of sympathy to him until this warden came along.
            With joy in his heart he went back to work, and worked as he had never worked
            before. It goes to show that the handling of men is a matter of judgment; and
            that one man, the right man, with a few words of kindness can accomplish more
            than a score armed with guns and clubs. While there were just as many guns and
            clubs in the <a href="#prison">Nebraska prison</a> as there were in that
            eastern <a href="#prison">prison</a> where mutiny holds high carnival
            right now, they were not used, for this warden detested government by force and
            preferred and promoted government by peace and kindness.</p>
         
         <p>A democratic governor had been elected. No sooner did this become known at <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> than the boys circulated a petition
            among themselves and addressed it to Governor <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> asking that he not take Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a> away from them. The petition was, however, never mailed, as
            the warden held it back.</p>
         
         <p>Now came the end of the biennium and the warden made his report to the governor
            and the legislature. The deficiency which former Warden <a href="#smith">Smith</a> predicted to be about ten thousand dollars was, however,
            thirteen thousand dollars; and considering that the state institutions in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> owed the <a href="#prison">prison</a>
            nearly ten thousand dollars for electric light, the actual deficiency was about
            four thousand dollars. At every place where there was a chance to save a penny -
            that penny was saved. The coal bill was given close attention and several
            thousand dollars were saved on that item. In his report the warden said that he
            had managed the <a href="#prison">prison</a> by open and aboveboard
            methods. There is not one receipt nor disbursement but what can be explained.
            The books are open and the public may come and see for themselves. He closes the
            report with a few words of cheer for the inmates, bids them dispense with
            despair, and with hope in their hearts look forward to better days to come.</p>
         
         <p>Now Christmas is the greatest holiday at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>!
            Usually the boys commence to make a lot of noise early in the morning but this
            morning everything was quiet; they were too downhearted to cheer for they had
            learned that their best friend was to leave them. When Chief Justice <a href="#reese">Reese</a> of the supreme court, speaking to the prisoners
            at the chapel service, made a kind mention of Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, this sentiment was cheered by the prisoners. One a colored
            man, the same one that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter; violated
            the rules by exclaiming: He is the best warden that we ever had. It was
            an unusual scene at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>, and those present
            were much impressed by the sentiment shown by the prisoners.</p>
         
         <p>No prisoner ever left the <a href="#prison">prison</a> without going to the
            warden's office and thanking him for his kind treatment. The scores of letters
            received from, the boys on the outside go to prove that Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>, as well as <a href="#msmeelick">Mrs.
               Melick</a>, will never be forgotten by those unfortunates who happened to
            come to <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>.</p>
         
         <p>On the last day of Warden <a href="#melick">Melick's</a> administration a
            minstrel show was given in honor of the members of the legislature, at the close
            of which Doctor <a href="#harmon">Harmon</a>, on behalf of the inmates,
            presented to the warden a silver service enclosed in a massive chest. Upon each
            piece of the service the warden's initials were engraved. The boys had taken up
            a collection among themselves. When the list was sent to my office, I noticed
            that several men had put down all the money that they had on deposit. I took the
            list and called on these men, who told me that they wanted to give all they had,
            and would like to give much more had they only possessed it. They said that they
            wanted to give the warden a present that he would be proud of as long as he
            lived. After much discussion pro and con, I finally made them understand that it
            was the spirit of the gift far more than the money value that the warden would
            appreciate. The contributions were then reduced to only a few cents per inmate.
            In his presentation speech Doctor <a href="#harmon">Harmon</a> said:
            <q>In the future, that whatever honor fortune or merit showers upon you,
               you will be remembered by these men as the best warden they ever
               had.</q></p>
         
         He who misfortune's hand has viewed<br></br>
         Upon his fellow man<br></br>
         With kindly thoughts his heart imbued<br></br>
         To lift it if he can;<br></br>
         He stands a prince among his kind,<br></br>
         At home or everywhere<br></br>
         Who deals with him will always find<br></br>
         This man is on the square.<br></br>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1>
         
         <h1> A PLEA FOR THE BOYS IN GRAY</h1>
         
         
         <p>In other chapters I have told my readers how the discharged prisoner is turned
            out into the world with only five dollars in money, dressed in a six dollar
            suit, a dollar and a quarter hat and a two dollar pair of shoes. It matters not
            whether he has served one year or twenty, nor whether his home is in <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a> or in the extreme western part of the state.
            It is five dollars to one and all; and if that amount is insufficient to take
            them to their home, they will have to walk, fly, beg or steal. If they choose
            the latter and are caught; it will cost the state some more money in keeping
            them and bringing them back to <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a>.</p>
         
         <p>I have also told you how the paroled men are turned out into the world, with no
            money whatever. They are not even furnished a suit of clothes, but have to
            depend upon the prison officials for old clothes or go out into the world in
            their convict garb.</p>
         
         <p>I appeal to you, good people of <a href="#nebraska">Nebraska</a>, to do all
            you can to remedy this. A law has been passed to properly equip the outgoing
            inmates; but the legislature forgot to appropriate funds for this purpose, and
            the convict gets nothing, not even a credit memorandum for what is due him.
            There are plenty of other funds; and, especially do I call my reader's attention
            to the general repair fund of twelve thousand dollars, of which amount over
            one-half will perhaps not be used, and at the end of the biennium returned to
            the state. And while this fund was appropriated for general repairs, I believe
            that the board of commissioners for the state institutions has the authority to
            change these funds as they see fit. At any rate it would be well to take the
            matter up and have the attorney general pass on it. If this cannot be done, the
            matter must be taken up with the legislature. Some one should be on hand in the
            legislative halls to see that it is attended to. The legislature also passed a
            law providing for payment of earnings to the prisoners; but again they forgot to
            appropriate funds for such a purpose; and again the prisoners get nothing, not
            even a credit memorandum. If this, their just dues, was paid them, they could
            send this money to their wives and children who now live in poverty and misery.
            Will not some one start the ball rolling by calling on the governor or on the
            board, to have this wrong rectified? I wish to appeal to you who employ labor,
            and call your attention to the paroled men. Of these men, ninety out of each
            hundred make good; they cannot quit just when they please, but are under the
            supervision of the warden and the board. You assume no financial responsibility
            when you employ such a man, and you perform indeed a Christian and charitable
            act.</p>
         
         <p>Several associations work to better the outgoing men. The <a href="#nebraskaprisonassociation">Nebraska Prison Association</a> has
            its office in the Little Building, <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>. Its
            members are men of the highest standing. Its superintendents are Captain <a href="#gifford">Gifford</a> and Rev. Doctor <a href="#bullock">Bullock</a>. Then there is the Helping Hand Prison Association. Its
            officers are <a href="#barrett">James Barrett</a>, President; <a href="#hamlin">G. E. Hamlin</a>, Secretary; <a href="#williamson">V.
               A. Williamson</a>, Vice-President; and <a href="#burling">P. R.
               Burling</a>, Treasurer. Its members are <a href="#spangler">G. A.
               Spangler</a>, <a href="#persley">M. Persley</a>, <a href="#kester">W. 0. Kester</a>, <a href="#hyers">Sheriff
               Hyers</a>, <a href="#farrier">John Farrier</a>, <a href="#burd">L. L. Burd</a>, <a href="#jewel">J. E. Jewel</a>, <a href="#loftin">W. S. Loftin</a>, <a href="#rambaugh">A.
               Rumbaugh</a>, <a href="#bancroft">R. Bancroft</a>, <a href="#oRambaugh">0. Rumbaugh</a>, <a href="#ferrier">W. M.
               Ferrier</a>, <a href="#opper">R. Opper</a>, <a href="#adams">A.
               E. Adams</a>, <a href="#berry">A. L. Berry</a>, and <a href="#styne">William Styne</a>. I know all the officers of these two
            associations and I have found them to be men, real men, who are working without
            remuneration to aid their fallen brothers. If you, my reader, wish to contribute
            a little for the benefit of the outgoing prisoner, then contribute to either one
            of these two associations, and shun all others. Give no aid to the others,
            although they sail under the title of <q>Reverend</q> or
            <q>Doctor</q> and have the seal of sanctimonousness (sic)
            stamped upon their faces. Some of these latter come along and talk
            <q>penitentiary</q> to you and make you believe that they are
            connected with the <a href="#prison">prison</a>; but with the exception of
            <q>bumming</q> a few meals, they have no connection with it
            whatever. Leave such reptiles alone.</p>

         <h1>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1>
         
         <h1> WILL GOVERNOR MOREHEAD FEED THREE SNAKES?</h1>
         
         
         <p>Shortly after the election I had to go to <a href="#claycenter">Clay
               Center</a> on a law suit. I registered at the Davis hotel. <q>Well, how
               is the pen?</q> said some of my friends in the lobby. <q>It is in good
               condition,</q> was my answer. <q>Who is Governor <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> going to put in as
               &#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;?,</q>
            they asked me. I told them that I did not know, but hoped that the present
            incumbent would be reappointed. <q>Well, he never will, for <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a> has already appointed Mr.
               &#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;</q>
            said a state official who had just come in to register. <q>And what office
               will Mr. &#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013; and
               Mr.
               &#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;
               get?</q> I asked. <q>Well, I do not know for certain, but they will
               get something.</q>
            <q>Do you mean to say that Governor <a href="#morehead">Morehead</a>
               will feed these snakes?</q> asked one of the gentlemen in the lobby.
            <q>You just wait and see for yourselves,</q> said the gentleman from
            the state house. <q>Well, if he does, he will get but few votes in <a href="#clay">Clay county</a> if he ever runs again</q> said
            several of the men. However, the <a href="#morehead">governor</a>
            appointed only two of them, one at the <a href="#prison">penitentiary</a>
            and one at another state institution; and, had he known the facts as they were,
            he would never have appointed them. One of them came to the <a href="#prison">prison</a> to enter upon his duties. He came into my
            office, held out his hand, and professed to be delighted to see me. I turned and
            walked away from him, for rather would I take the slimy form of a rattlesnake
            into my hand than to touch the hand of this man. And the other party? He is not
            much better. For some years he drew a salary from the state, but was too busy
            masticating tobacco to do any real work. I have heard him insult men because
            they were republicans, and I have heard him apply his pet nick-name, that of
            <q>tape worm</q> to those that he disliked - a filthy old man,
            a disgrace to our state. As I have stated, my own sins are many. I have been
            wild and shiftless in my younger days; but I challenge those two gentlemen or
            anyone to prove that I have ever lowered the dignity of my office by either
            grafting from the inmates, directly or indirectly, (and I have had many chances
            to do so) nor have I lived in open adultery with a woman while having a wife and
            children of my own, for I never succeeded in getting a wife - not to speak of
            two, and I have never made <q>dates</q> with the wives, sisters
            and daughters of the prisoners, on the pretence that I possessed sufficient
            influence to get their relatives out of prison; nor have I been a
            <q>chippy chaser</q> on the dark streets of <a href="#lincoln">Lincoln</a>, for most of my evenings were spent at the
            desk, adjusting matters on the books that were left open by my predecessor, who,
            however did not forget to draw his salary check. And snake number three, what
            became of him? Why, he appealed to Warden <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a> for
            the position as steward at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>. When the
            warden told him that a steward had been appointed, this man was willing to
            accept the office of chief clerk. When he learned that this position was also
            filled, he, patient as he was, offered his services as a guard, but this, too,
            was refused.</p>
         
         <p>These three men are all over sixty years old. It was their favorite pastime to
            gather in an office and talk ill about Warden <a href="#delahunty">Delahunty</a> and the great church to which he belonged. Soon each of
            these men will be in a little pine box covered with earth, and then they will
            stand before that great tribunal above and receive the sentence due them for
            their misdeeds.</p>

         <h1>CHAPTER FORTY </h1>
         
         <h1>THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE</h1>
         
         
         <p>The new democratic warden is <a href="#fenton">William T. Fenton</a>,
            formerly sheriff of <a href="#richardson">Richardson county</a>. He
            engaged my services for six months, gave me a square deal, and religiously kept
            every promise he made me. For many years he has served as sheriff of <a href="#richardson">Richardson county</a>, and has proven himself to be a
            brave and efficient officer. <a href="#richardson">Richardson county</a>,
            on account of its location bordering on this and two other states, had for years
            been a rendezvous for criminals, especially horse thieves, but Sheriff <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a> drove these gentlemen out to seek shelter in
            other places; and while performing this duty he often took chances of being
            killed. On the night of the outbreak at the <a href="#prison">prison</a>,
            he received a message that the three desperadoes were on a freight train headed
            for<a href="#fallsCity"> Falls City</a>. The sheriff accompanied by
            Deputy Sheriff <a href="#mcfarland">McFarland</a>, and Chief of Police
            <a href="#copaldrich">Aldrich</a>, were already on guard in the
            railroad yards when the message came, and soon the train arrived. Sheriff <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a> searched the train and came upon an empty car
            in which were three men. He ordered them to come out, but they refused. Then at
            the risk of his life, he jumped into the car; with a pistol in his hand. He
            ordered the three men to holdup, their hands and get out, of the car, Which they
            did. While two of them answered the description of <a href="#gray">Shorty
               Gray</a> and <a href="#dowd">Dowd</a>, they, however were not the
            dynamiters. Together with Sheriffs <a href="#fisher">Fisher</a> of <a href="#otoe">Otoe</a> and <a href="#quinton">Quinton</a> of <a href="#cass">Cass county</a>, Sheriff <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>
            organized a posse to follow up the desperadoes, and they left for <a href="#sarpy">Sarpy county</a> on a special train.</p>
         
         <p>I was glad indeed that the office came to Mr. <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a>,
            for I have known him for several years and found him to be a kind man and a
            gentleman. I knew that he would give the boys a square deal and keep up the good
            work commenced by Warden <a href="#melick">Melick</a>. He started in
            fighting the <q>dope</q> traffic. In this he was aided by the new
            law passed, making the bringing of <q>dope</q> into the <a href="#prison">prison</a> a felony, and now the use of dope is reduced
            to the minimum.</p>
         
         <p>Hitherto the warden had been in supreme command, but on July 1, 1913 came the
            board of commissioners for state institutions. They are to the warden what the
            duma is to the once mighty czar of <a href="#russia">Russia</a>. The
            warden's hands, as well as those at the head of the other state institutions,
            are tied by this board. A mighty good thing for the taxpayers of the state is
            this board, that is, when it comes to spending the coin. Domiciled in luxurious
            quarters in our ready-to-fall statehouse, are the offices of these three
            distinguished gentlemen, who are to save their own and their employees'
            salaries, and office supplies amounting to about fourteen thousand dollars per
            annum, by careful buying of supplies for the state institutions, as well as
            preventing graft at the different institutions. In the future all grafting will
            be done by this august body, and thus save the briber's railroad fare to the
            various institutions. However, this applies to the future and not to the
            present, as the three commissioners now in office are men of the highest
            character and integrity and are, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. Two of
            them are lawyers, one is a farmer, though the public somewhat expected to see a
            practical business man on the board. The purchases for all state institutions
            are made once every three months and samples are submitted. The merchants who
            bid on supplies are permitted to come to the office and take their place in the
            dead line, which means that mum is the word. Now commences one
            of <a href="#holcomb">Governor Holcomb's</a> famous tea parties. Eight or
            ten merchants submit samples, each of nine or ten different kinds of teas. Tea
            pots and hot water are brought in and the brewing of tea commences. Tasting a
            cup of tea, <a href="#holcomb">Governor Holcomb</a> says to a merchant,
            <q>This is mighty nice tea. What is the price of it?</q>
            <q>Seventy cents, <a href="#holcomb">governor</a>, this is Tipton's
               number one.</q>
            <q>Heavens, no,</q> says Mr. <a href="#gerdes">Gerdes</a>.
            <q>Down where I lived we used to get some from Montgomery Ward for nine
               cents. It was good stuff, too, and red as oxblood. Haven't you got some of
               that?</q>
            <q>Here is something that tastes good to me,</q> says Judge <a href="#kennedy">Kennedy</a> to another merchant. <q>How much is
               this?</q>
            <q>Well gentlemen,</q> says the merchant, <q>on account of my good
               furtune; which I stand ready to share with you, I offer this tea for twelve
               and nine-tenths cents. Before the outbreak of the revolution in <a href="#china">China</a> and the capture of Ching-Chung Chow, I had
               bought large quantities. of this tea and stored it in <a href="#hongKong">Hong Kong</a>. This same tea now sells for eighteen
               cents by other firms, and is going still higher.</q></p>
         
         <p>And now comes Mr. <a href="#gerdes">Gerdes'</a> coffee party. <q>What is
               this kind worth?</q> says Mr. <a href="#gerdes">Gerdes</a>,
            sampling a cup of coffee. <q>We would let that go for forty cents per
               pound,</q> says the merchant. That is decided to be too dear; and after
            sampling about eighty other kinds, Mr. <a href="#gerdes">Gerdes</a>, in
            despair, asks if there are no samples of Carbuckles coffee at all. There is not;
            but finally a brand worth seventeen cents is selected and the coffee party is at
            an end. On the purchases of tea and coffee, the board has saved the state nearly
            ten dollars, which helps to make up the salary and expenses of the board of
            about forty dollars for the two days. And not only does the board save money by
            making purchases, but also by reducing and refusing unnecessary and extravagant
            requests for supplies. For instance, fruit cannot be bought on contract, and all
            requests for such must go to the board. Here comes a request from Superintendent
            So-and-so for bananas, for this superintendent likes bananas for breakfast.
            <q>Didn't we let him have some bananas the other day?</q> says one
            member. <q>Yes we did,</q> says another. The request for such a luxury is
            refused, but the superintendent, however, may buy some at his own expense.
            Another dime is saved.</p>
         
         <p>And recently the board has shown its usefulness in still another matter. It has
            sent out notice to all superintendents to get rid right speedily of all
            relatives who are on the pay roll - save one, as permitted by law. Gus.
            Buchholz, farm superintendent at the <a href="#prison">penitentiary</a>,
            came first, he being the brother-in-law of <a href="#prison">Henry
               Gerdes</a>, a member of the board. I feel sorry for the state in this
            instance, for Mr. <a href="#buchholz">Buchholz</a> is the best farm
            superintendent the <a href="#prison">prison</a> ever had, and was just the
            right man for the position a well as a good, true man and a gentleman. The
            warden will have to hunt a long time to find a man a competent as Mr. <a href="#buchholz">Buchholz</a>. Several other wives, daughters, aunts and
            cousins had to walk the plank. At the Soldier's Home at Milford, Colonel David
            Rowdin, the commandant, cleaved onto his son, who is the adjutant of the home,
            and presented his wife, daughter and son-in-law with their time checks. The
            board goes on to announce that it will not permit the shifting of relatives of
            one superintendent to the jurisdiction of another. At Hastings, Superintendent
            Baxter of the <a href="#insaneasylum">insane asylum</a> has a choice
            between his wife, who is the matron, and the daughter. The daughter walks the
            plank. At the <a href="#prison">prison</a>, Warden <a href="#fenton">Fenton</a> accepts the resignation of a cousin, <a href="#wjFenton">W. J. Fenton</a>, who is a guard and a competent one at that. A flock of
            relatives at the other institutions are preparing to go, and it looks as if
            every superintendent must get their books of genealogy and trace back at least
            seven generations. In this respect Mr. N. C. Abbott, superintendent of the state
            school for the blind, at Beatrice, has them all beaten. He has before him his
            book of genealogy and can trace back for seven generations. When his second
            laundress quits, and a woman by the name of Abbott is appointed to take her
            place, the superintendent after a careful search, sits down and writes to the
            board that it is with regret that he reports the loss by resignation of one of
            his most valued employes (sic), and that he has Mabel Abbott to take her place.
            In order to prevent the newspaper boys from throwing any fits on the, score of
            nepotism, he adds that she is of German origin, while his branch of the Abbotts
            has picked up no foreign blood save that of Spanish, Irish, Jew and Swedish.</p>
         
         <p>And not even the method of that sterling democrat, Mr. <a href="#smith">T. W.
               Smith</a>, the former warden, seems to fit for this occasion, for when
            Uncle Sam discontinued the <a href="#lancaster">Lancaster</a> post office,
            his daughter, the postmistress, automatically became short of a position that
            had paid her about thirty dollars per month. Mr. <a href="#smith">Smith</a> appointed her a mail clerk at a salary of thirty-five dollars.
            It appears to me that the only thing for the army of dear ones to do is to go
            hunting for other places. In this undertaking I extend to them my heartfelt,
            sympathy, and hope that they all succeed.</p>

         <h1>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE </h1>
         
         <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
         
         
         <p>In conclusion I wish to thank all those good people who have worked so hard and
            faithfully and done so much for the boys in gray. May the good Lord bless them
            and theirs. From the bottom of my heart I thank those who have extended to me
            the hand of friendship and good fellowship; I shall do my best to show that I am
            worthy of such friendship. Towards the state of Nebraska, my conscience is
            clear, as well as towards those unfortunate boys at Lancaster. I challenge
            anyone to show where I have converted to my personal use one penny belonging
            either to them or to the state, or to show where I have committed one single act
            unbecoming a gentleman while in the service of the state. I pride myself on
            having brought order out of the chaos that the former incumbent of the office so
            kindly left for me. I feel pleased and happy that the governor and the warden
            were satisfied with my work. Those who read this book, I thank them for their
            patience. To those busybodies who for a long time have been so busy criticising
            (sic) me, I have said much in foregoing chapters. To them I shall say no more
            except, to quote to them a poem by Richard Mansfield:</p>
         
         
         "If once at bay I touched a crime<br></br>
         In boyhood's hot-head heedless time<br></br>
         And all my neighbors rang the chime<br></br>
         Wherever I might wander,<br></br>
         Do you believe I could outlive,<br></br>
         Or that my neighbors would forgive<br></br>
         That stretching chain of slander?<br></br>
         Do you believe that I could rise<br></br>
         And by my doughty deeds and wise<br></br>
         Wash out that blot, I wonder?<br></br>
         Or if I strived in doing good,<br></br>
         And saving all the souls I could<br></br>
         Wherever I might wander,<br></br>
         Would that one stain upon my name<br></br>
         Outweigh my labor and my fame?<br></br>
         Alas! You know it would.<br></br>
         Would all my struggles, all my tears,<br></br>
         For days and nights, for months, for years,<br></br>
         Be ever understood?<br></br>
         My sorrow and my piteous prayer<br></br>
         Might reach Almighty's gracious ear<br></br>
         But would my neighbor hear?"<br></br>
         "Oh, gentle kind!<br></br>
         Oh, kind mankind!<br></br>
         Oh, thieves and liars deaf and blind,<br></br>
         But never, never dumb.<br></br>
         Oh, beasts that drabble in your pen,<br></br>
         And beasts that wear the garb of men,<br></br>
         What honor to be one!<br></br>
         Could I have hid that early crime<br></br>
         And tuned. my sycophantine chime<br></br>
         To key with pleasing lies<br></br>
         And stuff beast's loathsome belly full<br></br>
         And pat his elephantine hull,<br></br>
         Or please his amorous eyes,<br></br>
         How good were I! How wise were I!<br></br>
         How well I'd live! How damned I'd die!"<br></br>
         
         
         
         <p>My soul is filled with peace and my heart is full of joy. It matters not to me
            that my neighbors will not hear my piteous prayers, for well do I know that they
            will reach the gracious ear of Him, Who said to the robber upon the cross:
            "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise. </p>

            Penitentiary; Edward D. Davis was born in the northern part of Wales, November
            16, 1846, and came with his parents to Johnstown, Pennsylvania at an early age.
            Here he grew to manhood, receiving a common school education. In 1863 he
            enlisted in the hundred-day service, and in 1864 re-enlisted in the Eighty-third
            Pennsylvania volunteer infantry, and served to the close of the war. He was
            married May 10, 1871 to Miss Elizabeth Rees, also a native of Wales. His father
            died in 1883, and his mother in 1889, a victim of the Johnstown flood. In 1878
            Mr. and Mrs. <a href="#davis">Davis</a> came to Clay County, locating at
            Glenville, where he followed blacksmithing until elected sheriff in 1887. He
            held the office of sheriff for four terms and was a popular and efficient
            officer. He was a man of splendid physical power and courage. He was accustomed
            to deal with criminals and was fearless in the discharge of his duties. After
            retiring from the sheriff's office he and Mrs. Davis traveled a great deal. He
            practically retired from active life except one term as warden of the
            penitentiary. He retained business interests in Clay Center, being stockholder
            in the Commercial State Bank of which he was at one time the vice-president. He
            was a member of the Masons, Odd Fellows and A. O. U. W. At Lancaster, <a href="#davis">Mr. Davis</a> was well liked by officers and

      <p>*<span> This is a reference for the unamed Poet quoted in chapter 11. The author
            wrote a poem called <cite>Be Careful What You Say</cite>. This is the name of
            the poem which a portion of which is quoted in that paragraph. This poem has
            appeared in a variety of newspapers as early as 1899
            and as recently as  2005. Nobody has been able to trace
            the name of the author. None of the early versions of this poem are listed as
            having an author but you can find the poem now attributed to a Joseph Kronthal.
            I can't find where or why this happened. </span>*</p>

      <p><b>state: </b>Illinois</p>
      <p>*<span>Currently this theatre is called CIBC Theatre in Chicago. It opened on New
            Year's Day as the Majestic Theatre in 1906. IT was the
            first venue in Chicago to cost over a million dollars to build. It was the
            tallest building in Chicago when it was built, and became a landmark for the
            city. The theatre became a popular detination for vaudeville acts. Over the
            years the theatre has been closed and reopend under various names until it
            recieved it's current one in 2015. The theatre has
            undergone extensive restoration to maintain its original features and grandeur
            over the last century. </span>*</p>

      <p><b>state: </b>Nebraska</p>
      <p>*<span> As Nebraska grew, a need for a hospital arose. In 1887, they established the hospital in Hastings and transferred
            patients from other hospitals in Lincoln and Norfolk. The hospital grew and
            became largely self-sustainable through requiring labor from the patients in an
            effort to make the hospital able to feed itself. There was a large farm and
            dairy to support this. It was mostly a place for patients to reside with
            supervision until the  early 1920s
            when the first efforts to treat the mentally ill began. These efforts were of
            the nature of most early pyschiatric efforts such as electroshock therapy. After
            most of the mental hospital efforts were discontinued in the late 80s part of the facilty was
            converted into a minimum security prison.This was discontinued in 2002, due to budget cuts. It's been approved for a new
            facility and new living units, and demolition of some of the old buildings has
            begun. A new Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center for females is scheduled
            to open this year (2020 or 2021).
