                    <p><!--this is where our bios will go-->Following the idea of Anthony
                        Engebretson&#8211;Danielle Beaudoin, Tanima Shrivastava, and Łukasz Niparko
                        teamed up to transcribe, code, and digitalize Walter Wilson’s 1913 book
                            <title>“Hell in Nebraska: A Tale of the Nebraska Penitentiary.”</title>
                        They embarked on this journey to Nebraska State Penitentiary as part of
                        their Digital Humanities course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
                        (UNL)—Digital Archives and Editions with Prof. Amanda Gailey (ENGL
                        478/878).</p>
                    <p>Anthony Engebretson is a graduate student and employee at UNL, he will begin
                        pursuing a Master’s degree with the History department in the fall. For the
                            <title>“Hell in Nebraska”</title> project, Anthony transcribed and coded
                        Chapters 1-10 and the prelude. <q><emph>"When looking for texts that would
                                be interesting for a project, I wanted to find something that would
                                give insight on the history of incarceration. It felt very relevant
                                with discussions of prison and police reform (or the abolition of
                                these institutions entirely) gaining so much prominence. I focused
                                my purview on incarceration in Nebraska. It wasn’t long before I
                                came across a bizarre little book called ‘Hell in Nebraska’.
                                Wilson’s intent with writing this book was to destigmatize prison.
                                In many ways, he portrayed a relatively nuanced and sympathetic view
                                of prisoners, but at the same time he clearly had many prejudices
                                and biases, and his interaction with the system was anything but
                                challenging. But he inadvertently provided us an interesting look at
                                the state of Nebraska’s carceral system in the early 20th
                                century."</emph></q></p>
                    <p>Danielle Beaudoin is a UNL undergraduate student in the Department of
                        Anthropology, with a focus in cultural anthropology, and with plans to do a
                        service year with AmeriCorps, and then pursue a Masters in Library Sciences
                        with a focus on archival work. For the <title>“Hell in Nebraska”</title>
                        project, Danielle was responsible for transcription and coding Chapters
                        11-21, the conclusion, the front and back matter, along with the note from
                        the editors. <q><emph>I have an interest in bridging the gaps in the system
                                which disproportionately affect BIPOC across all avenues such as
                                health care, education, incarceration, among others. This project is
                                incredibly important when considering all the work that needs to be
                                done in leveling the inequity of these institutions in our culture.
                                “Hell in Nebraska” is a look into how the prison system and the
                                legal system historically functioned. Many of the biases and
                                prejudices expressed in this work are still in effect today, and
                                still influence the systemic racism in this country. It’s important
                                to recognize that not much has changed in that
                        regard.</emph></q></p>
                    <p>Tanima Shrivastava is a UNL undergrad with the College of Arts and Science
                        with Computer Science and English majors and a minor in Mathematics. For the
                            <title>“Hell in Nebraska”</title> project, she was responsible for
                        dividing the transcription tasks for the group, transcribing and coding for
                        Chapters 32-40, documenting steps for standardizing standoff elements,
                        writing CSS and personal bio and creating XSLT elements such as figure,
                        figDesc, note, list, references of persons and places and their child
                        elements such as occupation, region, name, note etc. <q><emph>I have
                                interest interdisciplinary studies, as a consequence of which my
                                concentration of English major is in Digital Humanities. I am

                                project is exciting to work with, as it not only presented a
                                technical design challenge, it also creates awareness about the
                                state of prisoners in Nebraska. It is surprising how despite
                                documents such as these, reforms have still not been implemented in
                                such institutions to better the recreation of the outcasts of the
                                society. </emph></q></p>

                        transcription and coding Chapters 22-32. <q><emph>"While doing so, I was
                                thinking of the past and present of American and European
                                penitentiary systems; just as now also back then, restorative
                                justice was only something to dream about, and to some extent, the
                                prison experience in Wilson’s time seemed to be more organic—at
                                least less free from corporate ties and the ultimate
                                school-to-prison pipeline, though unfree from discrimination and
                                various human rights violations that Wilson unwillingly describes

                <head type="title">THE TIGER IN HIS DEN</head>

                <p> Two ladies came into my office one afternoon and asked if they could go through
                    the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison.</ref>
                    <said>"And do you think it would be perfectly safe for us to go through?"</said>
                    said one. I told them that nobody would harm them. <said>"Why, of course, it is
                        safe to go in there,"</said> said the other, <said>"I told you so all the
                        time. The prisoners are locked up in steel cages and those who are out in
                        the yard are wearing ball and chains, and if one should start after us, we
                        could tell him a mile off by his striped clothes."</said> I took the ladies
                    inside the prison. From the chapel they went to the library. The librarian, a
                    young man, told them how many volumes were in the library; from there we went to
                    this greenhouse where the florist gave each a carnation, and from there through
                    the yard into the cell building. There were no prisoners in the cells, for they
                    were working in the factories. </p>
                <p>
                    <said>"Well, when do we get to see the prisoners?"</said> asked the ladies.
                        <said>"Madam,"</said> I said, <said>"the librarian and the man who gave you
                        the flowers and all the men here in the yard, are prisoners."</said> The
                    ladies looked surprised, and said, <said>"Why none of them wear chains, they
                        don't even wear stripes. This is so different from what we expected to
                        see."</said>
                </p>
                <p>Throughout the great <ref target="#nebraska">state</ref> are hundreds of people,
                    who like these two ladies, have entirely wrong ideas of this much advertised
                        <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison.</ref>, of its managers and of
                    its inmates. They think that the former are brutes and slave drivers, and the
                    latter desperate criminals, always kept penned up in cages like the tigers in a
                    menagerie. To fully explain, to set the public right, and to correct the many
                    wrong conceptions about the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Nebraska State
                        Penitentiary</ref>, its managers and its inmates is, far more than financial
                    gain, the object of this little book; and if you, dear reader, will now follow
                    me through the big <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, I will show
                    you, no ferocious animals, but men, mere men, who have made a little mistake in
                    life, and who are taking their medicine like men. I will show you some prison
                    officials, who are men also, men with red blood in their veins, men with hearts
                    full of sympathy for their fallen brothers; and I will show you the cleanest,
                    most sanitary and best managed prison in the <ref target="#unitedstates"
                        >country</ref>. Just follow me, there will be neither lions nor tigers to
                    injure you. </p>

                <head type="title">THE KINGDOM OF LANCASTER</head>

                <p>Visitors to the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> take the car
                    marked <q>"Penitentiary"</q> leaving <ref target="#tenthando">Tenth and O
                        Streets</ref> every forty minutes. The <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >penitentiary</ref> is located in a suburb called <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lancaster</ref>, or rather, <ref target="#lincoln">Lancaster</ref> is
                    located at the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>, for
                    outside of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> there is but
                    little else at <ref target="#lincoln">Lancaster</ref>. There is a railroad with
                    a signpost but without a depot; there is a post office with a few stamps, but
                    without a postmaster and there is a little store with root beer, none of that
                    which made made <ref target="#milwaukee">Milwaukee</ref> famous. </p>
                <p>
                    <ref target="#lincoln">Lancaster</ref> is a little independent kingdom, for its
                    inhabitants upon entering are not subject to the laws of <ref target="#nebraska"
                        >Nebraska</ref>, but to the rules and regulations set down by the warden,
                    the uncrowned king, who is a far more independent ruler than any monarch of
                    Europe, he being not only king, but senate and house of representatives all in
                    one; his word is law, and his will supreme. The present ruler, <ref
                        target="#fenton">William T. Fenton</ref>, of the Dynasty of <ref
                        target="#richardson">Richardson</ref> county, ascended the throne on January
                    the eighteenth, 1913, and the inhabitants immediately swore allegiance to him.
                    The Crown Prince is the heir apparent and the regent in the absence of the king;
                    he is also called the Deputy Warden, and his name is <ref target="#harmon">N. T.
                        Harmon</ref>. </p>
                <p>A cabinet of six high moguls assist in the government and they are: Secretary of
                    State and foreign affairs, Mr. <ref target="#oconnell">James O'Connell</ref>,
                    (Chief Clerk); Secretary of Commerce, <ref target="#kirby">W. A. Kirby</ref>,
                    (Steward); Secretary of War, <ref target="#kavanaugh">Dan Kavanaugh</ref>,
                    (Assistant Deputy Warden); Secretary of the Interior, <ref target="#cokely">Tom
                        Cokely</ref>, (Yardmaster); and Secretary of Agriculture, <ref
                        target="#buchholz">Gus Buchholz</ref>. The office of Secretary of the Navy
                    was discontinued by orders from the throne, the present regime being much
                    opposed to ships, especially schooners that pass late in the night and carry
                    forbidden cargoes. </p>
                <p>There is also a matron who has charge of all the female inhabitants in the
                    kingdom. At the present writing there are seven, all of dusky hue, and all
                    suffragettes. There is a chief engineer, Mr. <ref target="#mccarthy"
                        >McCarthy</ref>, who makes the big wheels go around, and makes the lights
                    shine over the land. He is a man of ability, a high grade mechanic and almost
                    indispensable to the state. There is a chaplain, who, with the exception of two
                    hours on the Sabbath morning, when he pilots the sinners toward the pearly gate,
                    is kept busy drawing and expending his enormous salary. Then there are two
                    turnkeys, who have the keys in their custody and are the connecting links
                    between the outside and the inside, or rather, as a sanctimonious old lady
                    mission worker told me once, <said>"they stand between good and evil."</said>
                    There was vitriol in the stare she gave me when I answered: <said>"You are
                        right, Madam, there are so many evil people wandering around here craning
                        their necks to get to look at the good people on the inside."</said>
                </p>
                <p>There is a standing army of thirty-five men called guards by outsiders, and
                        <soCalled>"screws"</soCalled> by the inmates. Where or how the latter name
                    originated I do not know, but it is used in all prisons. The army has its
                    headquarters in a large dormitory over the chapel where it sleeps on its arms,
                    ready for service in case there should be a revolution in the kingdom. Assistant
                    Deputy Warden <ref target="#kavanaugh">Kavanaugh</ref> is the major general of
                    this army and Doctor <ref target="williams">G. E. Williams</ref> is the surgeon
                    general. Several famous sharpshooters serve in this army, such as Colonel <ref
                        target="#jenkins">Jack Jenkins</ref>, Colonel <ref target="#morse">Frank
                        Morse</ref>, and Mr. <ref target="#evans">Henry Evans</ref>. I should not
                    like to be the target for any of these three gentlemen, for when they shoot they
                    never miss their mark. Mr. <ref target="#evans">Evans</ref> has been connected
                    with the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> for several years, and
                    under several wardens. He has also served with <ref target="#genlawton">General
                        Lawton</ref> in the <ref target="#phillipines">Philippines</ref> where he
                    established a reputation as a daring soldier and a crack shot. He also displayed
                    great bravery on the day of the outbreak, of which I shall tell you later. Mr.
                        <ref target="#pendarvis">B. Pendarvis</ref> has also seen service under
                    several administrations and has proven himself to be a successful prison man.
                    Mr. <ref target="#chasberry">Chas. Berry</ref> is the oldest on the prison roll,
                    having served for over twenty years; he is in charge of factory "C." He is a
                    gentleman, and the right kind of a man for a public institution. </p>
                <p>The safety of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> at night is in
                    the hands of Mr. <ref target="#boyd">J. Boyd</ref>, for many years police
                    officer, and formerly special police of the worlds fair at <ref
                        target="#philadelphia">Philadelphia</ref>. Mr. <ref target="#boyd"
                        >Boyd</ref> is well acquainted with many crooks of international reputation. </p>
                <p> It is much to be regretted that the prison is compelled to furnish electric
                    light for several other public institutions, for while these are lighted in
                    splendid grandeur at all times of the night, the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> itself is short of lights at
                    night, while it really should be well supplied with lights, that anyone
                    approaching the prison could be seen. For what few lights there are now, credit
                    is due to former Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, who upon taking
                    office saw at a glance the importance of lights in front of the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. </p>
                <p>On the following page I present to my reader a photo of many members of the new
                    administration: Reading from left to right they are as follows: Mr. <ref
                        target="#cavanaro">A. Cavanaro</ref>, a splendid, clean-cut, young officer
                    who knows well how to handle men and is well liked by the inmates. The second
                    gentleman is <ref target="#kopf">David Kopf</ref>, manager of the guard's dining
                    room. Third is <ref target="#spelts">Louis Spelts</ref>, deputy steward. Fourth
                    is <ref target="#chasberry">Charles Berry</ref>; and next to him is Colonel <ref
                        target="#morse">Frank Morse</ref>, who has seen service also at the <ref
                        target="#iowapenitentiary"><ref target="#iowa">Iowa</ref>
                    Penitentiary</ref>. Mr. <ref target="#werner">Albert Werner</ref> is the sixth;
                    he is the deputy farm superintendent, and expert on raising beans. If it had not
                    been for the drouth he would have had a splendid crop of beans. Reading from
                    left to right, second row, sitting down, are: first, <ref target="#fenton"
                        >William J. Fenton</ref>, turnkey; second, Mr. <ref target="#buchholz">Gus
                        Buchholz</ref>, farm superintendent. <figure>

                    </figure> My friend <ref target="#buchholz">Gus</ref> is a thorough farm manager
                    and had it not been for his skill there would not have been much of a corn crop
                    this year. Third is Mr. <ref target="#hepfinger">William Hepfinger</ref>, a

                    and keeps the big dining room as clean as a pin. Next to him is Mr. <ref

                        >C. L. Stephens</ref>, who is so tall that he can look into the second tier
                    of cells in the cell building from the ground floor; next to him is Mr. <ref

                        >Philippine</ref> soldier, a brave young man and a fine fellow; and next

                    the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>. </p>
                <p>Why the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> was built in a hole in
                    the ground instead of on the hillside to the south is more than I can explain.
                    So low is the present location that in times of flood the basement has been
                    filled with water and the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> was
                    inaccessible except in boats. </p>
                <p> The administration building is a three and one-half story structure from which
                    extend two large buildings, called the east and west cell buildings
                    respectively, both of which face the public road. From his prison cell the
                    lonely convict sees the merry crowd pass to and from the little park a mile west
                    of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> called the
                        <soCalled>"Beer Garden"</soCalled>; girls and boys leaving the beer garden
                    in the early morning hours are usually feeling happy and serenade the convict in
                    his cell as they pass by, and he in return lets out a yell that can be heard a
                    mile away. Learned linguists differ somewhat on the meaning of this yell.
                        <sic>some</sic> translate it into: <said>"Never mind, some day I will be
                        there too,"</said> while others say that it means: <said>"Oh, if I only had
                        a girl like you."</said>
                </p>
                <p> A tall wall extends from the cell building to the south. It is a gray and gloomy
                    old wall and serves to keep those in who would like to get out, and to prevent
                    anyone from breaking into the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >penintentiary</ref>. Several snakes make their home here in the old wall,
                    while on top of it are six towers, in each of which sits a guard with a loaded
                    rifle. There is a big gate in the east wall, and in the tower above it sits a
                    crackshot of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, Colonel <ref
                        target="#jenkins">Jack Jenkins</ref>, with his hand on his rifle, ever ready
                    for business. At the gate stands another official Mr. <ref target="#morse">Frank
                        Morse</ref>, who carefully inspects each incoming and outgoing wagon and
                    searches all the <soCalled>"Trusties"</soCalled> who pass through the gate. Due
                    to his vigilance no one attempts to smuggle contraband, such as guns or
                        <soCalled>"dope,"</soCalled> into the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref> by this route. </p>
                <p>To the north of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> is a garden,
                    where trusty prisoners raise large quantities of vegetables for the inmates'
                    kitchen. There is also an orchard, but it is like the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, located on too low ground and
                    is a failure so far as fruit is concerned, for it produces only sufficient fruit
                    in a season to make a dozen pies, but it is a success as a screen for escaping
                    inmates. To the west and south are located the two hundred acres of farm land
                    belonging to the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. There is a
                    small lake south of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> wall
                    and about three acres of land which is not used except to give room for some old
                    sheds. I have called the attention of several senators to this piece of land and
                    to extending the south wall to take in this piece of land and the lake. There
                    are some large trees and shrubbery on it, and it would make a splendid
                    recreation park for the boys; and by moving the green house to the shore of the
                    lake a most beautiful landscape could be effected. Unfortunately there was never
                    enough cash on hand with which to carry this through, but I hope there will be
                    some day; and I believe that the state would save in a few years, on drugs and
                    castor oil, far more than the cost of construction. </p>
                <p>Having seen all there is to see on the outside of the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, let us now see the inside. </p>
                <p>To the right as you enter, is the reception room. A card on the door reads
                        <q>"Come without knocking; go out the same way."</q> This card is a relic of
                    the Honorable <ref target="#robb">Mont Robb</ref>, a former official, who did
                    not believe in knockers, especially those who knocked the Honorable <ref
                        target="#robb">Mont Robb</ref>. In this room is where the visitors wait for
                    the ushers to come and take them through the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref>. For years it was customary to pay ten cents to go through and
                    see the entire <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref> upon taking office, discontinued the charging
                    of the admission fee, saying in his report to the governor, that he deemed it
                    unjust to charge the taxpayers a fee to see an institution that they themselves
                    maintained. The going through was entirely discontinued by Warden <ref
                        target="#fenton">Fenton</ref>, who did this as a matter of precaution in
                    order to keep out the <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> So there is no more
                    sightseeing at the big <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> except
                    in case you have a friend serving time there, in which event you may come and
                    visit him on the second Thursday of each month. You may talk to your friend
                    through the screen, but there is no hand shaking, no lovemaking, no kissing; and
                    a guard walks up and down and hears what you talk about. Those who visit must
                    come perfectly sober, for even the smallest fragrance of the stuff that made
                        <ref target="#kentucky">Kentucky</ref> famous upon their breath means that
                    they do not go in; and you must not carry any bottles in your hip pocket, for
                    there is a new law passed, making it a felony to bring opium or whiskey into the
                    pen&#8212;so be careful. </p>
                <p>Opposite the reception room is the warden's office and that of the chief clerk.
                    On the other side of the hall is the old abandoned postoffice, now used for the
                    steward's headquarters. One stairway leads down into the basement where are the
                    warden's kitchens and warerooms, and, another leads upstairs to the warden's
                    apartments on the second floor, and to the deputy warden's apartments on the
                    third floor. Here is also the female department. </p>
                <p>I have always thought that it was a shame to send a woman to the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>. There has been one
                    hundred and four female inmates in this <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref> since its establishment in 1869, of which fifty-eight were
                    negroes, one an Indian, and forty-five white women. The rooms in the women's
                    department are large and airy and resemble more the rooms in a hotel than prison
                    quarters. Two women occupy one room, and all they have to do is to keep their
                    quarters clean. I wish that all the girls working in shops and stores could have
                    as comfortable rooms as these prison girls at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>. There are at present six
                    colored women and one white woman. Of the one hundred and four women, sixty were
                    sent here for larceny, two for horse stealing, one for aiding in rape, and two,
                    (strange, but nevertheless true) for rape, sixteen for murder, and the remainder
                    for assaults of various kinds. On the outside, their occupations were:
                    fifty-five domestics, thirteen demimondes, one teacher, one snake charmer; and
                    the others had no occupation. The women seem to get along nicely, they attend
                    services every Sunday and generally do as they please. I think it would be much
                    better for the women if they had some work to occupy their minds while in
                    prison, but there does. not seem to be anything suitable for them to do. </p>
                <p> At the base of the hall is a big steel door behind which is the turnkey's room.
                    When once you enter here you are under lock and key. In this room is a large
                    safe, containing the keys of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref>. The chief turnkey, Mr. <ref target="#shurtleff"
                        >Shurtleff</ref>, is the custodian and is responsible for them. So expert
                    has this gentleman become in handling the prison keys that he can tell
                    blindfolded where any key belongs. He will ask the ladies to leave their
                    handbags in his care while they visit the inside, which is a precautionary
                    measure taken to keep out the <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> From here we enter
                    the chapel where services are held on Sunday morning. All the inmates, both male
                    and female attend this service, and notwithstanding that there are forty
                    churches in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, a large crowd of women from
                        <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> come out to the prison church also.
                    Whether these young women come to worship their Lord, or to gaze at the
                    prisoners, I will leave for my reader to guess, or rather come to church some
                    Sunday and see for yourself. If you come to church, be sure and be at the prison
                    entrance at fifteen minutes to ten o'clock, for at that time the big steel doors
                    close and they do not swing open for anyone while the inmates are at church. The
                    services last an hour, and you will hear some good singing by the prison choir
                    and beautiful music by the prison band and orchestra. </p>
                <p>After the service there is Sunday-school for an hour and at twelve o'clock the
                    inmates march to their dinner and the doors open for you to go home. In one
                    corner of the chapel is the deputy warden's office with the rogues' gallery.
                    Opposite is the library containing nearly four thousand volumes, mostly fiction,
                    and under supervision of a life time inmate. A large steel door leads from the
                    chapel into the west cell house, which is large and spacious. Here sleep those
                    men who work in the contract shops. There are cells to accommodate over, four
                    hundred. Following the outbreak Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> set
                    about to find an experienced prison man to take charge of this building. He went
                    looking for a man who would treat the prisoners with. kindness arid yet be firm
                    enough to keep the place quiet, in good order and also in good sanitary
                    condition; such a man he found at <ref target="#ftmadison">Fort Madison, <ref
                            target="#iowa">Iowa.</ref></ref>, penitentiary, in the person of Mr.
                        <ref target="#hesse">John L. Hesse</ref>, an experienced prison man, who has
                    kept the big building in first class condition ever since. There is also another
                    and smaller cell building in which sleep all the trusties and those prisoners
                    not working on contract labor. This room also serves as practice room for the
                    band and orchestra. From there we pass into the guards' dining room and
                    kitchens. There is not much to see in this department, for it looks more like an
                    old barn than a place for state officials to eat, however, it is going to be
                    remodeled. Passing out into the yard, we see another building under
                    construction, the first floor of which will serve as the inmates' dining room
                    and kitchen, and I doubt if there is a better or more modern dining room in any
                    prison in the country than this will be when completed. The second story will be
                    used for a hospital, and will be as modern as any hospital anywhere. The floors
                    throughout are to be of white marble; there will be a perfectly equipped
                    operating room, twelve large rooms for the sick boys, a place for the insane and
                    a separate ward for consumptives. There will also be a dark room, a special diet
                    kitchen, a dispensary and a private consultation room. </p>
                <p> This building is being erected by superintendent of construction, Mr. <ref
                        target="#hester">W. B. Hester</ref>, who with the exception of two
                    mechanics, uses inmate labor only. To the east of the new building is the
                    greenhouse, located in the center of a beautiful little park. In the greenhouse
                    can be seen two of the curiosities of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref>, an ever blooming Lantana Vine, sixteen years old, which has
                    become as large as a tree, and perhaps the largest goldfish in the <ref
                        target="#nebraska">state</ref>, <soCalled>"Old Bill."</soCalled> The boys
                    say that he is serving a life sentence for he has been there longer than any
                    other inmate, and seems to be perfectly satisfied. The greenhouse is managed by
                    a life term prisoner, who loves his work and raises many beautiful oleanders,
                    palms, and hybiscus, cacti, and many other rare plants and flowers. </p>
                <p>From the greenhouse we pass to the workshops. There is a chair factory turning
                    out some of the most beautiful reed and rattan chairs, some retailing as high as
                    forty dollars: Then there is a broom factory and a whiskbroom factory. These
                    three factories employ about two hundred men. There is a modern laundry, and a
                    cold storage plant, and the engine rooms and the
                        <soCalled>"hanghouse,"</soCalled> which is now being torn down as there will
                    be no more hangings in <ref target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>. You have now seen
                    the inside of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> from start to
                    finish, as the average visitor sees it. In the following chapter I will show it
                    to you as the incoming prisoner sees it. </p>

                    <said>"Which <ref target="#willie">Willie</ref>, Madam?"</said> was my answer,
                        <said>"we have so many Willies here."</said>
                    <said>"Who is this anyway? I thought it was Mrs. Jones."</said>
                    <said>"No Madam, this is the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                            >penitentiary</ref>, and we will take good care of <ref target="#willie"
                            >Willie</ref> when he comes."</said>
                    <said>"No, for heavens sake, no; don't believe that my <ref target="#willie"
                            >Willie</ref> will ever come to the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                            >penitentiary</ref>."</said> Maybe <ref target="#willie">Willie</ref>
                    will, and maybe <ref target="#willie">Willie</ref> won't; and let us hope that
                        <ref target="#willie">Willie</ref> don't; but man not being master of his
                    own destiny can never tell what may happen to him. There are three hundred and
                    sixty men in the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> now and there
                    is capacity for a hundred more; but if all those who by rights should be in
                    prison, but did not get caught, were to go there, it would be necessary to
                    enlarge it many times. The three hundred and sixty happened to get caught, and
                    that is why they are there. There has been behind these gloomy walls some of the
                    brightest men in the <ref target="#unitedstates">country</ref>, bankers,
                    lawyers, state officials, judges, doctors, merchants, and others. If you had
                    told any one of these men that he was to land in the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref> some day, he would not
                    believe it. I shall mention one particular case, a man who had been a banker for
                    years, and a mine owner in a western state, and for a while everything seemed to
                    come his way. He lived in regal style at one of the finest hotels and moved in
                    the best of society. </p>
                <p>One evening he called the head waiter to his table and scolded him for putting
                    carnations on his table instead of roses. <said>"You know well, that I do not
                        enjoy my meals except with plenty of roses on my table."</said> The head
                    waiter bowed deeply and apologized, for the mine owner was a liberal patron. He
                    would see that this awful mistake should not happen again.</p>
                <p>The mine owner was a heavy plunger and speculator and when the panic came along
                    it wiped him off the financial map. Within a month he became penniless, gave a
                    check where there were not sufficient funds to meet it&#8212;results: a year and
                    some months in <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>. He was
                    assigned to work in the inmates' dining room to scrub the floors, and had to
                    walk in water when he scrubbed. As he sat in the corner by his lonesome eating
                    his dinner, he saw no roses, no cut glass, no waiters in full dress suits, no
                    fashionable ladies and no soft music. No, he sat on a wooden bench, and ate his
                    pork and beans out of a rusty tin plate. A large roach and several small ones
                    devoured what crumbs of the coarse corn bread fell upon the floor. How the
                    mighty have fallen! How things have changed! To this man, his trip became a
                    lesson and changed him entirely. Never again for him! </p>
                <p>If you had told this man a year previous to his coming here that he was to land
                    in the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>, he would have
                    told you that you were to land in an insane asylum; but it is easy to get into
                        <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, and hard to get out; so
                    if you, dear reader, should happen to overdraw your bank account, or if you
                    should carry a gun, concealed in your pocket, or if you should happen to love a
                    young girl slightly under eighteen, or something else, you too, might become a
                    guest at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, providing that you
                    got caught. Here is what would happen to you: His honor, the judge, would say to
                    you: <said>"It is now adjudged by the court, that you, <ref target="#willie"
                            >Willie</ref> Jones, be imprisoned in the penitentiary located in or
                        near the city of, <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>,<ref
                            target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> for a period of not less than one, nor
                        more than twenty years, at hard labor, Sundays and holidays excepted, none
                        of this time to be spent in solitary confinement. The sheriff will, with all
                        possible speed and within thirty days, take you hence and deliver you to the
                        warden of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >penitentiary</ref>."</said> This is what is called the indeterminate
                    sentence. If you are good and attend to your own business you will be summoned
                    before the pardon board when you have served ten months and given a hearing, and
                    it is then determined when you are to go out. </p>
                <p>When the sheriff brings a new prisoner, he takes him into the warden's office,
                    and turns over the commitment papers there. Some of the sheriffs will tell the
                    warden what a good man he is bringing, and others will tell him what a bad man
                    the prisoner is. There is one sheriff from the <ref target="#sandhills">sand
                        hills</ref>, who usually tells that he is bringing a notorious desperado,
                    that he had an awful time capturing him, but that he finally landed him. The
                    warden sizes up the new man and takes him into the office of the chief clerk
                    where he is booked and given a number. </p>
                <p>He then turns over the money he has for deposit in the prison bank, and his
                    jewelry for the safety deposit vault, and his cigarette papers for the waste
                    basket. From there he is taken to the office of the turnkey, and now he is
                    behind the prison bars. Here is where many a prisoner breaks down and cries
                    (when the turnkey opens the large steel door and bids him enter) for he realizes
                    that he is now a convict and that he must remain here perhaps for a long time. I
                    believe that in more than half the cases, were he pardoned right then and there,
                    that he would never again trespass against the laws of the land. I have seen
                    many a young fellow break down and cry bitterly, and often I have tried to
                    comfort him, and tell him not to worry, that the place is not as bad as it is
                    painted and that before long, perhaps he will gain his liberty. This makes them
                    feel better; they know they have a friend at the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> who sympathizes with them, and
                    with a somewhat lighter heart the new prisoner proceeds to the Bertillon room,
                    where the assistant deputy warden makes a record of every mark and scar upon his
                    body and measures the length and width of his head, his height, length of his
                    nose, of his left little finger, of his forearm, and of his left foot. His
                    picture is taken, and all this is filed away in case he should escape later on.
                    Then he puts on his prison uniform of gray and is now a full fledged convict. </p>
                <p>He is then taken before the deputy warden, who asks him to what church he
                    belongs, what education he received, whether he uses tobacco, opium or liquors,
                    how long he has lived in <ref target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> and what his
                    occupation is. Also he states the name and <sic>postoffice</sic> address of his
                    wife, children, father, mother, brothers and sisters, and all this is carefully
                    recorded. He signs an authority for the warden to receive and open his mail, and
                    he is asked to sign not only his name but his number as well. The number is,
                    however, only used as a matter of record and he is always called by his name,
                    and never by his number. It is explained to him that it pays to be good, and
                    that the better he is the sooner he gets out. The incoming man usually assures
                    the deputy that he is going to be good, for he wants to go home as soon as
                    possible. Once in a while a prisoner acts contrary; and I once heard a new negro
                    tell that he was a bad, bad man and that he could stand upon his head a few
                    years if necessary. <said>"All right, my boy,"</said> said the deputy, <said>"we
                        have had several here like you, they came in like roaring lions but went out
                        like little lambs. Your case shall have my special attention, and you will
                        be a good boy before you know it."</said> A German gentleman was received
                    once, who asked the deputy if he could work at his trade. <said>"What is your
                        trade?"</said> said the deputy warden. <said>"I am a glass blower,"</said>
                    was the reply. There being but few bottles blown in <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, the deputy warden thought it
                    better for him to make brooms for a few years, and thus have two trades, instead
                    of one. </p>
                <p>A young <sic>Roumanian</sic>came in from <ref target="#boxbuttec">Box Butte</ref>
                    county and asked if he could work as interpreter. He spoke all the mongrel
                    languages of the Balkan lands, and Arabian besides, and would do his best to
                    give satisfaction. <said>"Well, my boy, we speak but one language here, and
                        mighty little of that,"</said> said the deputy. For two years the
                        <sic>Roumanian</sic> shoveled coal. </p>
                <p>From the deputy warden's office, the new prisoner is taken to the cell keeper,
                    who like another hotel clerk, assigns him to a room, but he does not ask his
                    guest whether he will have a room with bath, nor if he wants to leave a call for
                    in the morning. No, all guests here receive the same accommodations; a steel
                    cell, about five feet wide, by seven feet long with two berths, of which the new
                    man has to take the upper. There is a stationary wash stand and toilet in each
                    cell. The cells are far too small for two men and it is torture indeed to be
                    penned up in such a little compartment. Some inmate, poetically inclined, wrote
                    the following tribute to his cell upon the wall, the day before he departed: </p>
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"My prison cell was small and dingy,</l>
                        <l>With here a bug and there a jigger,</l>
                        <l>The architect must been quite stingy</l>
                        <l>Or surely he would planned it bigger.</l>
                        <l>Soon roam I free beneath the stars,</l>
                        <l>And with pure joy my heart does swell,</l>
                        <l>Because I hate them prison bars,</l>
                        <l>That kept me in that awful little cell."</l>
                    </lg>
                </quote>
                <p>And while there is little poetry in this, there is a lot of truth. To the
                    incoming prisoner this narrow cell is a hell on earth, and very few of new men
                    get any sleep at all the first night spent in one. At nine o'clock a bell rings
                    which means to go to bed, then all lights in the cells go out. In the morning
                    the bell rings at six o'clock. The prisoners dress and go to their breakfast,
                    and from there back to their cells for a short rest. At seven the bell rings
                    again for them to go to work. The new man is assigned to his particular place,
                    and within a few days he becomes accustomed to the routine of the <ref

                <head type="title">LIFE AT THE PRISON</head>

                <p>He who has to serve a time at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>
                    may consider himself a part of one great, big machine. It is the same over and
                    over everlastingly. You awaken when the big bell rings at six o'clock in the
                    morning, you dress hurriedly. Soon another bell rings to notify you that
                    breakfast is ready. You all fall in line and march to the dining room, where you
                    will find but a small selection of delicacies on the bill of fare. It is hash,
                    white bread and coffee for about three hundred and sixty-five mornings out of
                    the year. </p>
                <p>The hash is made of fresh beef and potatoes, and is a substantial and nourishing
                    food. When you have had breakfast you go to your cell and take a little rest or
                    a smoke for ten or fifteen minutes; then another bell rings, which means line up
                    and go to work. The men walk in line, single file, but do not use the lock step.
                    As soon as they come into the shop they start to work immediately and keep it up
                    until noon. The shops manufacture brooms, whiskbrooms, and reed and rattan
                    chairs. You are supposed to work a certain amount called a task, and when your
                    task is done, you may sit down or keep working. What your work over your task is
                    credited to you and turned into the prison bank once a month. Of course there
                    are some men who never make any overtime and prefer to sit down and rest. At
                    noon the big whistle blows and the men march to the dining room. Here is served
                    a good substantial dinner, although it is plain. For many years there was but
                    little variety in the food or in the preparation of it. Upon taking office,
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> engaged for dining room
                    superintendent, Mr. <ref target="#walsh">Andrew Walsh</ref>, who had served as
                    chef for the officers in command of our army in the <ref target="#phillipines"
                        >Philippines</ref>. He at first gave the kitchens and dining room a general
                    cleaning out, and put in many new utensils. Then he commenced to serve meals in
                    true army style. How the boys did enjoy it! Formerly they used to know the
                    regular bill of fare by memory, but now they never knew what was coming. The
                    instruction from the warden was to feed good; have everything thoroughly
                    prepared, have it clean and waste as little as possible. I have seen many a meal
                    served in the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> that would far
                    surpass the meals served for a quarter in the restaurants; and I thought of the
                    "bread line," in the large cities, and the poor in our own city, and wished that
                    all the poor folks could fare as well as the boys at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>. The Sunday dinner usually
                    consisted of roast pork, brown gravy, mashed potatoes, and vegetables galore in
                    season. Coffee and ice water goes with the dinner. Let us hope that the present
                    warden will look alter the cows and install a silo and have some milk for the
                    boys. The following is a list of dishes served in as much variety for dinner as
                    possible: Roast fresh pork, roast beef, meat pie, beef with brown gravy, <ref
                        target="#newengland">New England</ref> boiled dinner, stews, boiled and
                    baked pork and beans, hamburger steak, beef roll, bean soup and vegetable soup,
                    boiled, mashed and fried potatoes, parsnips, tomatoes, onions, turnips, cabbage,
                    cauliflower and melons in season. These vegetables are raised in the prison
                    garden, are served in abundance, and the men like them. However, there is no
                    table cloth, no cut glass, no china or napkins, and no finger bowl. It may seem
                    a little queer for the new corner at first but he soon gets used to it. The
                    dishes are passed around by inmate waiters, who will not take a tip, for the
                    reason that there is no money behind the wails. If you wish for another piece of
                    bread, hold up your right hand, if water, hold up your cup, for there is no
                    talking at the table. </p>
                <p>Dinner over with, the boys go to their cells for half an hour's rest. At one
                    o'clock the big whistle again calls them to their work which lasts until five
                    o'clock, then they again march in line to the dining room to supper. The supper
                    consists of meat, vegetables, fruit, white bread and coffee or tea. The
                    following is a list of dishes served for supper: stewed prunes, stewed apricots,
                    peaches, apples or raisins, oatmeal, hominy, liver with gravy, fried bacon, meat
                    stew, corn bread, wheat bread, butter, potato cakes, biscuits&#8212;and the
                    latter are usually as good as mother used to make. From the dining room after
                    supper, the boys go to their cells and look for the mail man to come around. </p>
                <p>They are great readers indeed, and subscribe for many magazines and daily papers
                    from all parts of the world. A special favorite among the dailies is the
                            <q>"<ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> Daily Star,"</q> which has a
                    large list at all times. </p>
                <p>There are altogether nearly two hundred dailies and magazines received at the
                    pen. There are also about one hundred. letters received every day. The papers
                    and letters are distributed by the librarian, after first being read by the
                    chief clerk. He also distributes books from the library and each man can have a
                    book and read as much as he pleases. The boys feel very grateful towards
                    Assistant Postmaster <ref target="#ludlam">Ludlam</ref> of <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, who donates to the prison many returned and
                    uncalled for periodicals. Also many people of <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref> send their magazines to <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref> when they have read them. I have due respect for religious
                    publications, but with the exception of two Christian Science magazines and a
                    Catholic publication, there is but small demand for the religious magazines and
                    papers. The magazines and great weeklies are read and re-read until they fall to
                    pieces. Many of the boys like to read farm papers, for there are more farmers
                    than any other calling in the pen; and many of the city boys take a liking to
                    the farm papers - perhaps to be in as close touch with nature as circumstances
                    will permit. The library is managed by an inmate. The present librarian is a
                    young man serving a life sentence for a murder that he did not commit. He is an
                    actor, a fine singer, and comes from a good Irish family, but happened to get
                    mixed up with two tramps and now suffers the consequences. I sincerely hope that
                    some kind-hearted governor will reduce his sentence, which would be no more than
                    just. The two tramps are out long ago. He has put the library in as good
                    condition as any city library on the outside, and takes a great interest in his
                    work. </p>
                <p>The boys are glad to see the librarian come around, and they can now read until
                    nine o'clock. If they do not feel like reading they can lie down and talk, smoke
                    or rest. </p>
                <p>This is the way the boys spend their week days in the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. Those who have money in the
                    prison bank may order what groceries or delicacies they wish twice a week. They
                    are very fond of fruit and have some on hand nearly all the time. There is a
                    cigar stand in connection with the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref>, where they can buy several brands of chewing and smoking
                    tobacco and cigars; but they cannot buy any cigarettes, nor are they allowed to
                    smoke them. Saturday is <soCalled>"writing day,"</soCalled> and the librarian
                    passes around a sheet of paper to each man. The letters are read by the deputy
                    warden and mailed every Monday morning. Saturday is also bath day, and the men
                    march to the bath house to enjoy a shower bath. Sunday is a day of rest, the
                    same as in any other place. There are services in the chapel and Sunday-school
                    which last until noon. After dinner the Sunday edition of the <q>"<ref
                            target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> Daily Star"</q> is distributed and the
                    prisoners read the news and rest during the afternoon. Thus the time slips away
                    in the prison faster than you imagine. </p>
                <p>The boys look forward to the two great holidays, the Fourth of July and Christmas
                    day, not only for the elegant meal served on those days, and the liberty of the
                    yard, but because each holiday is to them a milestone on their tedious journey.

                <head type="title">THE BOYS IN GRAY</head>

                <p>By that I do not refer to the confederate soldiers, but to the boys at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>. Several years ago Warden
                        <ref target="#beemer">Beemer</ref> and his deputy, Mr. <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>, decided to discontinue the use of
                    striped suits and substitute them with dark gray ones like the uniforms worn by
                    the mail carriers, only not quite such good cloth. There are at this writing
                    about three hundred and sixty-five men at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref>, some serving from one year and up, and forty-eight serving
                    for life. I told you in the preface that many visitors at the pen come there and
                    expect to see a lot of desperadoes, but go away having seen only men&#8212;mere
                    men, men just like you and me, ordinary, everyday men. I divide these three
                    hundred and sixty-five men into three classes, something like this: perhaps
                    there are altogether twelve or fifteen desperate men, men who would kill you and
                    think nothing of it, no more than you would think of killing a fly; such men as
                    these enter the world as criminal and as such they will depart. Good Christian
                    workers will only lose time trying to convert them for nothing in the world will
                    ever convert them. Then there are thirty, maybe a little more or less, moral
                    degenerates, such as have committed crimes against the other sex or against
                    nature. Of these men I shall tell you more in one of the following chapters,
                    headed <q>"Prostitution in the Pen."</q> The balance of the population, a little
                    over three hundred, are the young men and those a little older, but who are
                    first offenders. From the first two classes, come the repeaters, for their mind
                    is set upon crime; and they leave the prison with their mind set to commit one
                    or more crimes and sooner or later come back; if they do not come back to <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, it is because they went to
                    some other pen, for they spend the biggest part of their lives behind the bars,
                    and consider themselves in luck when they are not locked up. It is to the first
                    offenders that I wish to call your particular attention. Do not think that
                    because a man happens to make one wrong step and falls, that he is lost forever,
                    but look upon these poor fellows with all the mercy you have in your heart.
                    These men are not there because they are users of whiskey, as lots of the
                        <soCalled>"soulsavers"</soCalled> will lead you to believe:<sic>"</sic> no,
                    they are there because of circumstances, or because of bad luck more than
                    anything else. And like a former employer of mine used to tell me, bad luck is
                    bad management; and it is just bad management more than anything else that
                    causes the young men to go to <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref>. What these young men needed before their trouble, more
                    than anything else, was a good friend, one who could advise and counsel them and
                    say to them: <said>"Don't do it."</said> One-half of these young men are
                    orphans, and the other half are young men who drifted away from home. They had
                    no one to guide them, or give them the few words of advice, that we all so much
                    need at times in our life. If these men needed a friend before they blundered,
                    they need him twofold when the big steel gate opens for them to enter the world
                    again. Here, my dear reader, is a chance for you and many others to do some good
                    in the world. I do not exactly mean to hand these men out a large roll of money.
                    On the other hand, don't do it, but help them to get employment; treat them like
                    men; do not remind them of their gloomy past but inspire hope within their
                    hearts; make them feel that they are men among men again, and in ninety-five
                    cases out of one hundred they will make good. There are men in the state, now
                    making good, men who are model citizens, and a pride of the community, and it is
                    extremely seldom that one of this kind comes back to prison. What <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> needs more than anything else, is what
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> suggested in his report to the
                    governor&#8212;it is his pet subject of prison reform for our state&#8212;the
                    segregation of the young then from the hardened criminals, if possible by
                    building a reformatory, or if this is impossible, making certain changes at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref> that would facilitate the
                    complete separation of the two classes. He was very anxious to carry this out,
                    and did more to promote segregation than any other warden ever did. I wish to
                    stop here and inform my reader of late one night in December when the warden had
                    finished dictating to me his report. </p>
                <p>I suggested to him that he permit me to send a carbon copy of the report to the
                    governor elect at <ref target="#fallscity">Falls City</ref>. I said, <said>"I
                        sincerely hope that the new governor will take interest in three of your
                        recommendations, namely, the segregation of the boys, the severe laws
                        against smuggling dope into the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                            >prison</ref> and the proper equipment of the outgoing inmate."</said>
                    While Governor <ref target="#morehead">Morehead</ref> never favored me with an
                    acknowledgement of this copy, I was pleased to read of him incorporating all
                    three of the warden's suggestions in his message to the legislature. Since then
                    the legislature has passed a law making it a felony to smuggle
                        <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> into the prisons, and has appropriated money for
                    the new reformatory; but I am very sorry that while they passed a law to equip
                    the discharged convict properly when he leaves, and to pay him a part of the
                    money that he earns in the pen, they forgot to appropriate the funds for this
                    purpose, and the boys will continue for two years to go out in the world in the
                    cheap suits that brand them everywhere as ex-convicts, and with only a
                    five-dollar bill for a new start in life. </p>
                <p>To Senator <ref target="#dodge">Dodge</ref> of <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref>,
                    the boys are much obliged for the passing of these bills. The <ref
                        target="#dodge">senator</ref> is a fine man, a leader among men, a man who
                    did much good and one who took the interests of the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> more to heart than any member of
                    the senate. The boys in gray admire and love Senator <ref target="#dodge"
                        >Dodge</ref> for his good work and there are some who would fight for him,
                    were it necessary. How different the business of our great state would be
                    conducted if all communities elected senators and representatives who took an
                    interest in their work like this <ref target="#dodge">senator</ref>. </p>
                <p>I went to the state house, and placed before each member of the legislature, the
                    warden's report. I had a long talk with many of them, and all were more or less
                    interested in the big prison. Most cordial of them all was Senator <ref
                        target="#dodge">Dodge</ref>, and I was surprised to learn how much he knew
                    of conditions at the pen. I was equally surprised at one of the representatives,
                    or I should have said <soCalled>"misrepresentatives,"</soCalled> of <ref
                        target="#lancasterc">Lancaster County</ref>, who, when I placed the report
                    upon his desk, promptly threw it into the waste basket. He was evidently too
                    busy to look at it, for he had his feet on his desk and was enjoying a cigar.
                    Now I will leave it to the reader's judgment, which is the best&#8212;to expend
                    a reasonable amount on the boys discharged at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref> and have them start out
                    right, or to turn them out in the winter without even an overcoat and with only
                    five dollars? Is it a wonder that some of these boys return? Had they been
                    properly equipped, they would perhaps never have come in contact with the law
                    again. </p>
                <p>To return to the boys, I must tell my reader why these men are at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, for every day I am asked,
                        <said>"But what did all these men do to come here?"</said> The answer is:
                        <said>"Some do one thing and some another."</said> During the last two
                    years, there were received four hundred and fifty. Their crimes were as follows:
                    burglary about one hundred and ten, larceny about fifty-five, larceny from
                    person about one hundred and thirty, horse stealing thirty-five, rape about
                    thirty, murder thirty-five, forgery fifty-five, safeblowing six, robbery
                    twenty-five, wife desertion three, carrying concealed weapons one, playing poker
                    three, chicken stealing one, cattle stealing nine, and the remainder assaults of
                    various kinds. <said>"Well, where do all these men come from?"</said> is another
                    question we answer every day. About one third came from <ref target="#omaha"
                        >Omaha</ref>. During the past two years thirty-six came from <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>; </p>
                <p><ref target="#richardsoncounty">Richardson</ref> County comes third with twenty;
                    and <ref target="#hallc">Hall</ref> and <ref target="#cassc">Cass</ref> Counties
                    furnish nineteen each; <ref target="#cheyennec">Cheyenne</ref>, and <ref
                        target="#boxbuttec">Box Butte</ref> sent a dozen each. The other counties
                    average from four to six, except the virtuous counties of <ref
                        target="#blainecounty">Blaine</ref> and <ref target="#loganc">Logan</ref>,
                    who pride themselves on never sending a man to the pen. <ref
                        target="#loupcounty">Loup</ref> County recently brought their first
                    prisoner. The kindhearted sheriff found a good place for this boy to work when
                    he was discharged. At this writing there are no prisoners from <ref
                        target="#loup">Loup</ref>, and there are also eighteen other counties who
                    are not represented. These are mostly the <sic>sparcely</sic> populated counties
                    in the sand hill regions. Of these men, seventy-seven were born in <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>, sixty-two were foreigners from all parts
                    of the globe, even from far away <ref target="#arabia">Arabia</ref>; from <ref
                        target="#japan">Japan</ref> and the <ref target="#phillipines"
                        >Philippine</ref> Islands, from <ref target="#haiti"><sic>Hayti</sic></ref>,
                        <ref target="#romania"><sic>Roumania</sic></ref>, <ref target="#greece"
                        >Greece</ref> and <ref target="#australia">Australia</ref>. <ref
                        target="#germany">Germany</ref> furnished nine, <ref target="#ireland"
                        >Ireland</ref> five, <ref target="#italy">Italy</ref> four, <ref
                        target="#denmark">Denmark</ref> four, and <ref target="#canada">Canada</ref>
                    ten. Of American born, but not born in <ref target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>,
                    there were forty-six from <ref target="#missouri">Missouri</ref>, forty-five
                    from <ref target="#iowa">Iowa</ref>, thirty-six from <ref target="#illinois"
                        >Illinois</ref>, nineteen from <ref target="#newyork">New York</ref>, and
                    the balance evenly from every state in the <ref target="#unitedstates"
                        >Union</ref>, with three from the little <ref target="#districtofcolumbia"
                        >District of Columbia</ref> . Of these two hundred and thirty-one pleaded
                    guilty, one hundred and nineteen pleaded not guilty. The fact that they pleaded
                    not guilty does not necessarily mean that they were innocent; nevertheless,
                    there is many an innocent boy serving at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref>. They came here, in all ages and sizes; four were
                    seventeen&#8212;nothing but children. (I would like to examine the heart of the
                    judge that sent these children to the pen. I think that he must have a heart of
                    rock or ice.) Seventy-one were from eighteen to twenty. Just think of it, gentle
                    reader! I know every one of these young men and I dare say that if the judge
                    would have taken sixty-five of them and not sentenced them, but paroled them
                    from the bench after having a heart to heart talk with them, none of them would
                    ever have gone to prison. But the courts must grind out a certain number of men.
                    There were one hundred and thirty from between twenty-one and twenty-five, just
                    the age when a young man knows it all, or thinks that he does. There were about
                    one hundred and fifty between twenty-five and thirty-five years old. About
                    eighty-five were between thirty-six and sixty, three were sixty-three, and one
                    was sixty-nine years old. Four hundred and eighteen had a common school
                    education, eight were high school graduates, seven could read but not write, and
                    seventeen were illiterate altogether. One hundred and twelve were married, nine
                    divorced and three hundred and twenty-nine single. Two hundred and thirty-eight
                    of the boys had lost their father, one hundred and eighty-nine had no mother;
                    and is it strange that these boys should go astray? Twenty had no relatives of
                    any kind. One hundred and forty-four were total abstainers, two hundred and
                    ninety-nine were users of liquors, mostly moderate drinkers; and while I am not
                    defending the saloons, I have learned from experience that circumstances and not
                    whiskey, are what sends most men behind the bars. Six were constant users of
                        <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> All religions are represented at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>, there being more Methodists
                    than any other religion. There were about one hundred Methodists. There were
                    less belonging to the Christian Science Church than any other, only one poor
                    little boy, one of the seventeen-year old ones. There were only two Jews. One
                    hundred and seventeen of the boys were not members of any church, but believed
                    in God. One only was a non-believer; but as a bullet from the sheriff's gun has
                    since blown him into other regions, he perhaps has changed his mind by this
                    time. The new indeterminate sentence law has gone into effect, and half of the
                    population have indeterminate sentences. It is up to them to be good and their
                    sentence will be a short one. About one hundred and fifty have sentences from
                    between one and three years. Eight have five years, seven have seven years, etc.
                    Six have fifteen years, three have twenty years, two have twenty-two years, and
                    there were fifteen received during the biennium with life sentences, making
                    forty-eight life time prisoners altogether. One, the <ref target="#prince"
                        >murderer</ref> of our beloved <ref target="#davis">deputy warden</ref> is
                    under a death sentence. </p>
                <p>As stated before there are men of all occupations at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>; and is it not strange that
                    one-third of the boys are farmers? There are one hundred and six laborers and
                    twenty-five cooks. The latter, might be wrong, for many of the prisoners state
                    that they are cooks in order to get to work in the kitchen. There are sixteen
                    barbers, nine bakers, six bookkeepers, eighteen painters, sixteen teamsters, one
                    acrobat and one sailor, the latter doing but little sailing at this time. There
                    is one doctor, one veterinary surgeon, and mechanics of all kinds. There are no
                    bankers in the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> now. And,
                    speaking of bankers, there are less crimes committed against the banks in <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> at the present time than ever before, for
                    the bankers are well organized, and, like the old <ref target="#safeblowjoe"

                        law passed to sentence us from twenty years to life for blowing a safe, it
                        is another state for me."</said> Surely did <ref target="#safeblowjoe"

                <p>Of the four hundred and fifty received, three hundred and sixty were first
                    offenders, while fifty-one were second timers and five were third timers. One
                    came back for the fourth time. The latter is still a young man, not yet thirty.

                <p>When you are taken sick while in prison you remain in your cell in the morning
                    after the other men have gone to their work. About nine o'clock the sick men
                    fall in line and march to the dispensary where Doctor <ref target="#williams"
                        >Williams</ref> looks you over and in nine cases out of ten prescribes for
                    you his favorite prescription, castor oil. You may have a broken leg, a pimple
                    on your eye, or a corn on your foot, castor oil cures them all. When the <ref
                        target="#williams">doctor</ref> first came to the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, there was for several mornings
                    a long line of sick men, but as the doctor administered to them the castor oil
                    treatment the line grew smaller and smaller. The <ref target="#williams"
                        >doctor</ref> is also an expert in appendicitis cases and has a ready cure
                    for all imaginary sickness. For instance an <ref target="#oldjoe">old
                        negro</ref> came wobbling up to his office. He was so weak and delicate that
                    he could hardly walk and he had to stop several times to take a rest. The <ref
                        target="#williams">doctor</ref> examined the old fellow carefully and said:
                        <said>"Well, <ref target="#oldjoe">Joe</ref>, what you need is an operation
                        for appendicitis, you get ready for this, this afternoon."</said>
                    <said>"Lawd, no, <ref target="#williams">Doctor</ref>, ah feels much improved
                        right this minute."</said> The amount of potatoes that <ref target="#oldjoe"
                        >Joe</ref> has peeled since that day is something wonderful, and he walks
                    around like a young man. No operation for <ref target="#oldjoe">Joe</ref>, well
                    I guess not. At times it is hard to discriminate between those who are shamming
                    and those who are really sick. The latter have indeed my sympathy, for their lot
                    is a most unhappy one. The <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> has
                    had a hospital consisting of one large room, which resembled a dormitory in some
                    cheap lodging house more than a hospital, and in here were housed those with
                    tubercular and private diseases, together with those temporarily sick, and these
                    were in constant danger of infection. However, this hospital is a thing of the
                    past, it having been torn down to make room for a new one to be as modern as man
                    and money can make it. The new one will be ready this fall. </p>
                <p>In spite of the meager hospital facilities, there are nevertheless fewer deaths
                    and less real sickness at the present time than in any other prison in the <ref
                        target="#unitedstates">country</ref>. Looking in retrospect over the year of
                    1912, there were only two deaths. In the month of July there were only eight
                    hundred and sixty calls at the dispensary for medicine as against one thousand
                    three hundred and twenty during July 1911. This splendid record must be credited
                    to the never tiring efforts of <ref target="#stradling">Doctor Stradling</ref>
                    and also to the good and well prepared food and the splendid music furnished by
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, as well as the clean and sanitary
                    condition in which the cells and factories are kept. </p>
                <p>Acting upon the recommendation of <ref target="#stradling">Doctor
                    Stradling</ref>, shower baths were installed and this serves much to promote
                    better health and is far more pleasant than the old tub baths. There ought to
                    be, and no doubt there will be before long, hot water installed in all the
                    cells. But what is needed more than anything else and what will do more towards
                    keeping the boys in good health, is a recreation park, which can be gotten by no
                    other expense than extending the east and west walls and moving the south wall
                    so to include the piece of land with the little lake to the south of the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, which at the present serves no
                    purpose except to give room for some old and ready-to-tumble-down shanties.</p>
                <p>Would it not be unpleasant to die behind the prison walls? And what becomes of
                    the dead bodies? For years they have been buried in a little graveyard on the
                    hillside to the south of the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>.
                    No marble monument marks the convict's grave, not even a painted board. The
                    coffin, a common pine box, is carried to the grave by convicts, and lowered into
                    the grave by them; then the grave is filled, and just a little mound indicates
                    that a human being is buried there. However, if the prisoner has money or
                    friends, the body is turned over to them. Recently a new law was passed, that of
                    turning over to medical colleges the bodies of those convicts who have no money.
                    A few years ago a man was under sentence to be hanged for murder. He had neither
                    money nor friends, and while he did not appear to be worried over having to
                    hang, he was always brooding over them turning his body over to a medical
                    college. On the day of his execution, he turned to Mr. <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref>, at that time deputy warden, and with tears in his eyes,
                    said, <said>"<ref target="#delahunty">Jim</ref>, there is one thing I wish to
                        ask of you, I haven't a cent, but for mercy's sake, don't let the students
                        get my body."</said> The kindhearted deputy took up a collection among the
                    officers, made up the balance himself and the boy had a Christian funeral and
                    rests in a cemetery in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. </p>

                    not only to the users themselves, but to the prison managers as well. It appears
                    that the use of <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> originated in <ref target="#england"
                        >England</ref> in the seventeenth century when times were hard and wages so
                    low that the people could not afford to indulge in ale or whiskey, but had to
                    find something cheaper, thus started the use of <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> It
                    was thought with wages rising that this <sic>practise</sic> would cease but it

                    the world, and once a slave of this deadly drug it is almost impossible to
                    dispense with it. To get it, a user will lie, steal, even commit murder, and
                    under the influence of it he will commit any crime on the calendar. Many
                    prisoners are users of <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> when they come to the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, and try to smuggle a supply in
                    with them in various ways, mostly in their shoes. I have seen the heels of a
                    pair of shoes hollowed out and sufficient <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> inserted
                    to last a man for several years. Of course this is promptly destroyed. Some of
                    the prisoners who never used it on the outside become users of it in prison.
                    Perhaps they are put in the cell with one of these <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled>
                    fiends who invites them to try it. They do, and like it. Soon they take another
                    jolt and before they know it, they become <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> fiends
                    themselves. </p>
                <p>There is, however, some excuse for prisoners using this poison. Some of them,
                    having been behind the bars for many years, completely shut off from all
                    stimulants, after years of hard work, and all the time doing over and over again
                    the same monotonous prison routine, find themselves some day mentally and
                    physically weak and in need of some stimulant, and not being able to get any
                    liquors, resort to <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> Others may be sick, or have some
                    grievance, imaginary or otherwise, and try to drown their troubles by using
                        <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> Looking at it in this light, there may be some
                    excuse for it; and if you, my reader, were lying in a little steel cell in
                    deadly pain or worried to death over the turn your affairs had taken, and sleep
                    would not come to you, if one little piece of morphine about the size of a
                    pin-head would put you to sleep, and give you sweet dreams besides, many of you
                    would fall for it. Dreams of the sweetest kind come to the users of

                    by Judge <ref target="#frost">Lincoln Frost</ref> before the Social Service
                    Club, dealing with the <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> habit and other vices at the
                        <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>. Before completing
                    this chapter I called upon the <ref target="#frost">judge</ref>. I asked him if
                    he had ever met Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>, and he said that
                    he did not even know him personally. I told him that I wished that he had called
                    upon the <ref target="#delahunty">warden</ref> and gotten the information from
                    him. There being always two sides to a story, it is well to hear both sides; and
                    if Judge <ref target="#frost">Frost</ref> had gone in person to the prison and
                    called upon the warden, I am certain that several errors that appear in his
                    paper would not have appeared there. For a fact one of the inmates who furnished
                    him with much information, especially against the inmate physician, Mr. <ref
                        target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref>, admitted to the <ref target="#frost"
                        >judge</ref> that he had himself sold <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> at the
                    pen. No matter what Mr. <ref target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref> has done behind
                    the prison bars, no matter what crime he committed to go there, give him his
                    dues; and if those who abuse him could have seen what I saw, when the prison
                    officials lay wounded&#8212;how tenderly they were cared for by Mr. <ref
                        target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref>&#8212;those people would themselves, if
                    possessed of a heart at all, suggest that he be pardoned. While it is true that
                    he is not a graduate physician, we must remember that the great state pays its
                    doctor only seventy-five dollars and for that little amount he cannot spend all
                    his time at the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. Rather than to
                    let a man injured in the factory bleed to death, is it not better to have him
                    attended to by one who understands how, even if he does not possess a diploma?
                    The story of him administering poison to another inmate, is too absurd to
                    comment upon. </p>
                <p>It is indeed surprising how the <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> is smuggled into the
                    prison. Some was concealed in the coal cars and a chalk mark made on the car.
                    Once a negro woman left some English walnuts, which we opened and found fined
                    with <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> and carefully pasted together. Another time a
                    woman brought several sacks of smoking tobacco, on which the revenue stamps had
                    been carefully removed, <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> inserted, and then carefully
                    sealed again. Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> had this woman arrested
                    and she served a sentence in the county jail. But to thoroughly and completely
                    eradicate this evil, you must have the law with you, and at Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref>'s suggestion, a law was enacted making it a
                    felony for bringing <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> and liquor into the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> and thus far no one has been
                    willing to take such chances. What a pity that this law was not passed many
                    years ago. </p>
                <p>On a cold winter night Judge <ref target="#frost">Frost</ref>, <ref
                        target="#roach">Rev. Roach</ref>, <ref target="#wilson">Bert Wilson</ref>
                    and a Mr. <ref target="#mcbride">McBride</ref> together with two ex-convicts
                    bent upon revenge, went to the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>
                    on the ten o'clock car, went to the wooden gate, called a trusty and handed to
                    him a bottle of morphine,&#8212; enough to kill several men. It was indeed a
                    nice affair for a former circuit judge to take part in. I am sorry that all of
                    these gentlemen were not nabbed and jailed which they should have been, two of
                    them committing a crime and the other four witnessing it. Was it a wonder that
                    such a judge was retired to obscurity? <ref target="#roach">Rev. Roach</ref> has
                    also been noted as a man attending more to other peoples' affairs than to his
                    own. <ref target="#wilson">Bert Wilson</ref> is the man who furnished a
                    traveling evangelist with much information that helped the city to go wet
                    instead of going dry; and Mr. <ref target="#mcbride">McBride</ref>&#8212;well,
                    his lyceum fame and obtain- ing thousands of dollars is well known to the
                    public. He succeeded in catching several prominent men fo sums ranging from
                    fifty to two hundred dollars and then his lyceum bureau went under. Had he not
                    better sweep before his own door and let his neighbor alone? </p>

                <p>Those of my readers who are so good, so modest, had better skip this chapter, for
                    it speaks about prostitution. <said>"What do you mean,"</said> asks my reader,
                        <said>"are not the two sexes segregated at the <ref

                    men being in one building and the women in another, and the two do never mingle.
                    The prostitution that exists is that which is <sic>practised</sic> by men among
                    men or by men to boys. To make it any plainer would perhaps land me in the
                    federal prison for many years, for it is unfit to print and transmit through the
                    mails. That my reader shall understand the situation, I will say <said>"Get your

                        letter to the Romans, especially the 26th and 27th verses, which read as

                                unto vile affections; for even their women did change the natural

                <p>Never did I imagine that a human being could thus lower himself, and if those old

                    other prison for that matter, could speak, they would reveal crimes like those
                        <ref target="#stpaul">Saint Paul</ref> writes about, crimes almost
                    unbelievable, <sic>practised</sic> by old offenders, serving long sentences and
                    being shut off from the opposite sex forever, upon the young inmates, crimes so
                    black that they would make the <soCalled>"hangers on"</soCalled> of an oriental

                    and look after your boys and keep them out of the <ref

                    unfortunate boys who have to go there, from the old sodomists by erecting
                    reformatories for these young men, where each individual boy can be watched and
                    each individual case receive that particular treatment which is most necessary.
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> speaks of this in his report, and
                    Governor <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref> in his message asked the
                    legislators to appropriate funds for such a reformatory, which they did, and
                    soon our state is to have such an institution. </p>

                <head type="chapter">CHAPTER EIGHT</head>
                <head type="title">WORK AT THE PRISON</head>

                <p>Idleness, the root of all evil, is unknown at the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">big prison</ref>; everybody works except the
                    sick in the hospital. Of the three hundred and fifty men, fifty work in the
                    chair factory, one hundred and fifty in the broom and brush factories and the
                    others work around the institution and as trusties on the farm and for
                    outsiders. The chair and broom factories are run by corporations, in no way
                    connected with the state. They buy the labor of the inmates and pay at the rate
                    of fifty-five cents per day for each man, and an additional five cents for each
                    man per day, which pays for rent, heat, light and power. Much has been said
                    against contract labor, and while it has its defects, in interfering with
                    outside labor yet it also has its good points. Many industries have been tried
                    and found wanting, such as the manufacture of harness, pearl buttons,
                    agricultural implements and shirts, while one industry has proven itself well
                    adapted for prison work, the manufacturing of brooms and whisk brooms. It is not
                    hard work, is clean and easily learned. A certain task is set and what is made
                    over and above the task is paid for and placed to the prisoner's credit in the
                    prison bank. The highest amount paid for overtime in the broom factory was
                    thirty-three dollars for one month, but only a few earn that much, and I judge
                    the average to be about three dollars per month. The dealings with the owners of
                    the broom factory have been satisfactory to the state as well as to the inmates.
                    The superintendent, Mr. <ref target="#johnson">Johnson</ref>, is a humane man
                    and a gentleman. He has made very few complaints against the inmates, and on the
                    other hand the inmates have made few complaints against him. </p>
                <p>The chair factory, an institution established a year ago, also gets along nicely.
                    It is very clean, the best of sanitary conditions prevail throughout it and the
                    boys have a chance to make a little money right along. Only the very finest of
                    reed, rattan and fibre chairs are manufactured, some selling for over forty
                    dollars, most of which are made by hand. Once a man masters this trade he can
                    command high wages. </p>
                <p> At the last session of the legislature a law was enacted, abolishing contract
                    labor in the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>, and thirty
                    thousand dollars were appropriated towards establishing a binder twine plant.
                    That amount is but a drop in the ocean when it comes to building a twine
                    factory. Other states have these plants, and an investment of nearly a quarter
                    of a million dollars has been needed of which one-third was used for buildings
                    and machinery, one-third for working capital and one-third for sisal, the raw
                    material. Owing to the perpetual revolutions in <ref target="#mexico"
                        >Mexico</ref> where the sisal is raised, it becomes necessary to buy it in
                    large quantities or sometime not get any. </p>
                <p>A large warehouse is needed and same should, for safety's sake, be built outside
                    the walls or it will be necessary to pay a heavy insurance premium on sisal
                    stored in this warehouse. One of the states that went to this large expense has
                    a modern and money making twine plant, but when running to its full capacity, it
                    employs only seventeen convicts. I doubt if this state will spend a quarter of a
                    million dollars to employ seventeen of its wards. Far better would it be for the
                    state to use the thirty thousand dollars towards purchasing the chair factory
                    when its contract expires. This plant already employs between fifty and sixty
                    men and is on the increase all the time. As there is no other factory of this
                    kind in the state, it would in no way interfere with outside labor. This factory
                    could, if acquired, be used for those men who were not admitted to the outside. </p>
                <p>Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, in his report, to the governor,
                    suggested that the state buy several tracts of land adjacent to the prison on
                    which to raise vegetables. Several of these tracts could be bought, one of which
                    could be irrigated in case of <sic>drouth</sic>. On this the warden would work
                    the young men, and the first offenders, and raise small fruits and vegetables in
                    abundance. While the prison now cultivates over two hundred acres of land yet
                    they buy large quantities of canned fruit and vegetables and many loads of
                    potatoes. With this land, and a small canning plant which could be established
                    for less than five hundred dollars, much money could be saved, and good healthy
                    work found for many of the men. </p>
                <p>In no other department of the prison is there room for as many improvements as
                    there is on the farm. Reformers say <said>"Why do not the poor prisoners get a
                        little milk once in a while?"</said> Well, reformers say so much and do so
                    little. It is easy to say a thing, but hard to do it, and it seems to be easier
                    to attend to other people's business than to mind one's own. For the benefit of
                    the readers I shall explain why the boys at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref> do not get any milk. First of all, the cows are not as good
                    milkers as they should be; second, because half of the cows are dry half of the
                    time; and third, because there has never been sufficient funds. on hand with
                    which to organize a dairy along modern lines. Seldom more than twelve cows are
                    milked, and these supply milk for the forty-two guards and employees and for the
                    families of the warden and the deputy warden. In order to go around, it becomes
                    necessary to measure the milk and cream most carefully. Frequently the officers
                    drink their coffee without cream for there is not enough. I know from experience
                    that at my table there was never any cream and I had to use water on my
                    breakfast food and drink black coffee. <said>"But why in the world don't you
                        feed lots of eggs to the boys?"</said> said one of these good women to me
                    one day. <said>"Well Madam, I wish you or I could lay some for the boys, for the
                        chickens won't,"</said> I told her. It is strange but true that when the
                        <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> had only nine hens the boys
                    would bring in on an average of seven eggs a day, but when we had over one
                    hundred hens the average was about seventeen. There must be something wrong
                    somewhere. The <ref target="#lincolnasylum">Asylum for the Insane at <ref
                            target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref></ref> has a large and well kept poultry
                    plant, and its manager, Colonel <ref target="#middleton">Middleton</ref> knows
                    the business from start to finish, and the big <ref target="#lincolnasylum"
                        >institution</ref> has chickens and eggs to spare. The <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref> has just as good
                    facilities and could just as well have such a plant and do away with buying
                    large quantities of eggs, as well as produce the chickens served to the inmates
                    on holidays. This branch would find employment for several men, as would a dairy
                    plant. There is also a chance to install a hosiery plant at the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. Such a one could be started
                    with a few machines and at a cost of less than five hundred dollars. It could
                    manufacture all the hosiery used in the prison as well as that used in other
                    state institutions. Employment could be found for a few men by installing a
                    little printery, for the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> uses
                    printed blanks in large quantities: and thus gradually and in various ways the
                    prisoners could be placed in such work that would in no way interfere with labor
                    on the outside. If any of the above should not meet with success we have the
                    public roads, sadly in need of improvement, to fall back upon. </p>

                <head type="title">A HELL IN NEBRASKA</head>

                <p>A hell on earth, a living tomb, exists within these prison walls. It is located
                    in the rear of the hospital and is commonly known as the
                        <soCalled>"hole."</soCalled> It consists of six small cells, all of which
                    are dark, save for a small opening about the size of a man's hand up under the
                    ceiling. There is no furniture in the hole, not even a bed, and the occupant
                    sleeps upon the stone floor. He who enters here leaves all hope behind and finds
                    only sorrow, misery and despair. The illustration on the back cover shows a
                    prisoner strung up in the hole. It matters not what physical condition he is in,
                    nor that nature demands it, he cannot move away from there, and even if he
                    could, there is no toilet within his reach. It is almost unbelievable that such
                    conditions exist in the twentieth century. There was but very little use made of
                    the <soCalled>"hole"</soCalled> during the humane Warden <ref target="#beemer"
                        >Beemer</ref>'s administration, for he and his deputy, Mr. <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> were experienced prison men, and knew
                    how to handle prisoners without it. Also the broom factory which was the only
                    prison industry at that time got along nicely with its men. During Warden <ref
                        target="#smith">Smith</ref>'s administration things changed for the worse. A
                        <ref target="#chicago">Chicago</ref> concern of slavedrivers, operating
                    shirt factories in eleven other prisons, started also a factory at <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>. Warden <ref target="#smith"
                        >Smith</ref>, in order to make a record for himself, that he might become
                    perpetual warden, was there to make a showing, cost what it might. His dream was
                    to make the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>
                    self-supporting, and he talked <soCalled>"self-supporting,"</soCalled> from
                    early to late, but other than talking of it, it never became any more
                    self-supporting than it ever was. The shirt factory was installed. From their
                    various factories came a collection of discarded, <sic>delapidated</sic>
                    machines, practically useless, but <soCalled>"good enough for <ref
                            target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>."</soCalled> Only five or
                    six out of the eighty were good new machines. The factory was established in a
                    poorly ventilated room, the men were crowded together like sardines, and the air
                    was at all times permeated with the poisonous blue dust from the cloth from
                    which the cheap shirts were made. It filled the mouths and the nostrils of the
                    men, so that they could hardly breathe, and caused much sickness among those
                    with weak lungs. Taking it as a whole, the shirt factory was a hell on earth. </p>
                <p>A heavy task was set, and it was impossible for the boys to make it on those old
                    machines. In justice to all concerned, credit must be given Mr. <ref
                        target="#peterson">W. O. Peterson</ref>, the general manager, for being a
                    humane man and a gentleman in every respect: but once a week there came from
                        <ref target="#chicago">Chicago</ref>, the Vice-President, a <ref
                        target="#cohenstein">Mr. Cohenstein</ref>, and when he came there was
                    trouble. As soon as he walked in, the boys would say: <said>"Well, here is the
                        sheeny, there is going to be trouble here today."</said> He usually came on
                    Saturdays and had the boys put in the <soCalled>"hole"</soCalled> over Sunday.
                    He would go straight to the task sheet, make up a list of those short in their
                    work and have as many put in the hole as possible. It is indeed strange that
                    some brutes are heralded as humane men, and some good, humane men heralded as
                    brutes and wicked sinners. Never before, nor since, have there been so many men
                    sent to the hole as during Mr. <ref target="#smith">Smith</ref>'s
                    administration. But <ref target="#uncletom">Uncle Tom</ref>, being an
                    auctioneer, knew how to spread the salve, knew how to pose as a saint, and the
                    old women <soCalled>"soulsavers"</soCalled> were his press agents. I do not mean
                    to say that there were no good points to Warden <ref target="#smith"
                    >Smith</ref>, on the other hand there were many, and as a purchasing agent he
                    was an especially good one. For instance, the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> uses wood in large quantities,
                    and no warden before or after him bought wood at such close figures as did Mr.
                        <ref target="#smith">Smith</ref>. There are several other articles that he
                    bought at great bargains. </p>
                <p>A memorandum was kept at the shirt factory of all who were short in their work,
                    and as soon as one gang was turned out of the <soCalled>"hole"</soCalled>
                    another was turned in, and there was always a waiting list. If this good, humane
                    warden had remained there for another term, it would have been necessary to
                    build an addition to this hole. </p>
                <p>At noontime a guard comes along with two slices of bread and a cup of water, and
                    that is your dinner. You are let down just long enough to eat this, and then you
                    are strung up again. At night he is let down to partake of the same kind of a
                    meal, and then sleeps on the stone floor, usually with his coat for a mattress,
                    and his shoes for a pillow, for company, there are plenty of large roaches, mice
                    and centipedes. After he has spent the required time in the hole, he is told to
                    go and make a task or he will go back for a longer trip. He is permitted to go
                    and take a bath and have a change of clothes, which is necessary on account of
                    lack of sanitary arrangements in the hole. How he enjoys that bath and those
                    clean clothes, even if they are second handed, and perhaps worn by a negro or a
                    person with a disease! Do you think, my reader, that he will ever forget the
                    hole as long as he lives? Upon the wall of the corridor one of these
                    unfortunates wrote with a wire nail: </p>

                <p>But what is the difference if a few convicts become paralyzed or crippled for the
                    rest of their lives, just so that the <ref target="#chicago">Chicago</ref>
                    slavedrivers fill their coffers and the dream of the warden comes true? Now some
                    of these <soCalled>"soulsavers"</soCalled> will tell you that I am not telling
                    the truth, and for you to go and take a look at the punishment records of <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref>; but I am telling you the
                    truth, and will prove it to you. According to law, the warden must keep a
                    punishment record, in which all punishments must be entered, but did Warden <ref
                        target="#smith">Smith</ref> do it? No; once in a while his chief clerk would
                    awaken from his peaceful slumber in his little corner of the office and quit
                    slobbering tobacco juice just long enough to make one or two entries. Perhaps
                    there was one entry for every fifty that should have been entered. Take for
                    instance when the negro, <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref>, was tried for the
                    murder of Deputy Warden <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref>, the court called for a
                    record to show that he was severely punished at the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>. Notwithstanding that he entered
                    into a conspiracy to kill a guard and to liberate a negro murderer under
                    sentence of death, and for which he received the worst punishment that he could
                    be given, that of a long stay in the hole, and the wearing of striped suit and
                    ball and chain; and there was applied to him also the water cure; there was no
                    trace of this entered upon the records, and like this, others were also omitted. </p>
                <p>It is a long road that has no turn. After <ref target="#smith">Tom Smith</ref>,
                    came a gentleman, a man with a heart and soul, <ref target="#delahunty">James
                        Delahunty</ref>, under who's administration the <ref target="#chicago"
                        >Chicago</ref> slavedrivers did not last long, for, as they said to Mr. <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>, <said>"If we cannot get these men
                        punished, we cannot make any money, and we shall retire as soon as our
                        contract expires."</said>
                    <said>"You may retire now,"</said> said the <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >warden</ref>, and during the month of June, 1911, they packed their trunks
                    and left <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">Lancaster</ref> for good. After Mr.
                        <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> was murdered, there came Warden
                        <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> who discontinued the use of the
                        <q>"hole,"</q> and kept the keys in his possession; but that is another
                    story and you will read about it in another chapter. </p>

                <p>No sooner has the judge pronounced sentence upon the prisoner than some one
                    commences to undo the sentence by helping the prisoner out of the <ref
                        target="#nebraskapenitentiary">penitentiary</ref>. Strange to say that the
                    greater the crime the more people there are on hand to come to the rescue of the
                    prisoner. Women, especially rush to the aid of the most notorious prisoners,
                    especially murderers and rapists. Why do they do it? Some do it because of real,
                    true sympathy, and because like the great Master did, they also visit and
                    comfort those who are in jail. These are the people I shall tell you about in
                    this chapter. </p>
                <p>A different kind of people are always ready to come and call on the prisoner. And
                    why do they do it? For the notoriety there is in it, for the sake of satisfying
                    their curiosity and perhaps for what graft there is in it. Of these
                        <soCalled>"would-be soul savers"</soCalled> shall tell you in a following
                    chapter. To tell the many good deeds done for these brothers in distress by the
                    good people would require a book much larger than this, so I will only mention
                    their names. First of all, I wish to mention my friend and also the friend of
                    every officer and inmate, Mr. <ref target="#roseborough">John M.
                        Roseborough</ref>, Professor at the <ref target="#university">State
                        University</ref>. He is a splendid young man, and his heart is in the right
                    place. Often has he hurried from his office, disregarding snow and rain, that he
                    could work with the boys during the evening. Then there is <ref target="#auld"
                        >Professor Auld</ref> of <ref target="#collegeview">College View</ref>. For
                    years this good man has taught Sunday-school at the prison. At present he is
                    working hard and faithfully to obtain clemency for <ref target="#andy">Andrew
                        Hawkins</ref>, the oldest inmate of the pen. Poor old <ref target="#andy"
                        >Andy</ref> has been there for nearly fourteen years, being sent up from
                        <ref target="#frontiercounty">Frontier County</ref> for murder. To the
                    officials around the prison it appears that poor old <ref target="#andy"
                        >Andy</ref> is innocent and was just made the <soCalled>"fall
                        guy"</soCalled> for the real murderers. Another good friend to the boys,
                    especially those from <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref>, is Mr. <ref
                        target="#sigler">Harry Sigler</ref>, superintendent of a charitable
                    institution of that city. Mr. <ref target="#sigler">Sigler</ref> has come in
                    contact with criminals of all kinds, large and small, young and old, and can
                    judge a person at first sight. He knows their shortcomings, their peculiarities
                    and even their slang. I remember the first sermon that Mr. <ref target="#sigler"
                        >Sigler</ref> preached at the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >prison</ref>. As the boys sat before him he recognized many familiar faces
                    and he made a direct appeal to them to do better, to lead cleaner lives when
                    they were liberated. He brought many a word into his sermon that you will not
                    find in the dictionary and was not understood by the outsiders attending church
                    that morning, but were known to those who have spent a long time in crime. They
                    listened to and appreciated that sermon more than any sermon they had ever heard
                    behind the bars. Seldom has a star of the footlights received more applause than
                    did Mr. <ref target="#sigler">Sigler</ref> on that winter morning. Officers and
                    visitors pressed forward to shake hands with this true friend. The inmates as
                    they bade good-bye to Mr. <ref target="#sigler">Sigler</ref> asked: <said>"When
                        will you be with us again?"</said> A man who has done much good in a quiet
                    way is Judge <ref target="#judgeengland">W. H. England</ref>. The <ref
                        target="#judgeengland">judge</ref> lives in <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref> and is too well known for me to chronicle his many good
                    deeds, suffice it to say that he stands as a mighty power for all that is good
                    and true. For many years Mr. <ref target="#enix">J. E. Enix</ref> has sacrificed
                    much of his valuable time to come to the prison and act as instructor to the
                    choir. No man ever did more good among the colored population than has the <ref
                        target="#may">Reverend May</ref>, of the <ref

                        >Lincoln</ref></ref>. Mr. <ref target="#may">May</ref> does his good work in
                    a quiet unpretentious way, and many a boy has found his <sic>Saviour</sic>
                    through the good work of Doctor <ref target="#may">May</ref>. As I pass the <ref

                    serves as parsonage for this <ref target="#may">minister</ref>, I often wish
                    that I was rich and could either build a new one or repair this parsonage which
                    is about ready to fall to pieces. You rich men and women of <ref

                <p>Many good women have come to the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref>
                    and have talked and read for the boys. First of all comes an angel in human
                    form, our beloved <ref target="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</ref>. Her earthly home
                    is in <ref target="#tabor">Tabor</ref>, <ref target="#iowa">Iowa</ref>, and her
                    other home will soon be in heaven for she is getting well along in years. She is
                    known from coast to coast, and for many years has been scattering sunshine among
                    the prisoners in every penitentiary in the <ref target="#unitedstates"
                        >country</ref>. Her hair is as white as snow and her heart is purer than
                    gold; she is indeed a true servant of the Lord. Years ago when this good woman
                    first started out on the road, she went to the general passenger agents of the
                    railroads and asked for passes. Sometimes the passes were slow in coming, but
                        <ref target="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</ref> kneeled down upon the floor and
                    sang a hymn and prayed to the Lord that He would turn the heart of the official
                    that she might go and see her boys. She never left the office without a pass,
                    and today <ref target="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</ref> receives, without asking
                    from the railroad companies, passes that carry her from coast to coast. Even big
                    corporations possess a soul and a heart, and long ago they learned of the good
                    done by this woman. On her last visit to <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref>, she was very weak and feeble and had a nurse with her. I
                    asked if she had not better lay off and take a rest for a few weeks, but she
                    told me that she could not do it, for <said>"I must call on my boys"</said> she
                    said. News travels fast even behind prison walls, and soon the boys learned that
                        <ref target="#wheaton">Mother Wheaton</ref> was with them and there was joy
                    in every heart, even in that of those who had never seen her before for they
                    knew about her and her work. There were tears in many eyes as the good <ref
                        target="#wheaton">mother</ref> asked the boys to sing <q>"Nearer my God to
                        Thee,"</q> for the boys realized that before long their good mother would be
                    with God in heaven. When the service is over, this good woman takes her place at
                    the door, shakes hands with every inmate and asks the Lord to bless them. A true
                    and well meant blessing indeed. </p>
                <p>Frequently Mrs. <ref target="#morrison">Bessie Gerhart Morrison</ref> comes to
                    the <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary">prison</ref> and entertains the boys. A
                    noble woman indeed is Mrs. <ref target="#morrison">Morrison</ref> and possessed
                    of much common sense. The boys look forward to her coming as one of their
                    greatest treats. The <ref target="#revstorm">Reverend Doctor Storm</ref> and his
                    daughter, <ref target="#ruthstorm">Miss Ruth</ref>, deserve much praise for
                    their work. <ref target="#ruthstorm">Miss Storm</ref> is the prison pianist,
                    without pay. <ref target="#wheeler">Mrs. Wheeler</ref> is another good friend of
                    the prisoners, and so is <ref target="#parke">Mrs. Parke</ref>. I like the
                    method of <ref target="#parke">Mrs. Parke</ref>; never does this good woman
                    force religion upon a prisoner, but she acts slowly and deliberately. She
                    appeals rather to a few at a time and gradually gains their confidence and
                    friendship. When the proper time comes, she talks with them about spiritual
                    affairs, and in this way <ref target="#parke">Mrs. Parke</ref> has done a world
                    of good among the boys. Several have found the blessed <sic>Saviour</sic>
                    through her earnest efforts, and every one of these boys has gone out and made
                    good. Three of them live in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> and are highly
                    respected citizens, an ornament to the community. May the good Lord grant this
                    worthy <ref target="#parke">woman</ref> many years to continue to serve the
                    Master. Many other good men and women have come forward to help lighten the
                    burden of the boys in gray, and when the final roll is called the Lord will find
                    a place for these good people close to the throne. </p>

                <head type="chapter"> CHAPTER ELEVEN</head>
                <head type="title">THE CHAPLAIN AT THE PEN </head>

                <p> The spiritual welfare of the prisoners is looked after by two chaplains, a
                    Catholic and a Protestant chaplain. Of these the former is paid nothing and the
                    latter the princely sum of fifty dollars per month.For many years the <ref
                        target="#moran"> Reverend Robert F. Moran</ref> has been the Catholic
                    chaplain, and no matter how the blizzards and storms raged, no matter how cold
                    it may be, <ref target="#moran">Father Moran</ref> was always at his unpaid post
                    of duty. As time passed by I came to love and admire this noble priest for his
                    sacrifices, for his good work and for his splendid personality. I am not a
                    Catholic, but in my boyhood days I was taken severely ill and spent two months
                    at one of their hospitals. Never shall I forget the kindness of those holy
                    sisters who took care of me. I remember one day that I thought that I had
                    sufficient strength to walk across the room but found myself too weak and
                    collapsed upon the floor. Two of these sisters found me and gently carried me to
                    my bed. Since that time never a year has gone by but what I have contributed to
                    this great organization. I have for years come in contact with many Catholic men
                    and women and have found more sincerity, more true worshippers among their faith
                    than among any other. For a fact I have not found one hypocrite, one agitator or
                    one conspirator among them. It has given me special pleasure from week to week
                    to destroy that lying cowardly sheet, published at <ref target="#aurora">
                        Aurora, Missouri</ref>, and sent for distribution among the inmates; and I
                    wish that those cowards, those imps of hell who publish this rotten paper, may,
                    before they depart for their proper hole in hell, meet with sickness and be
                    attended by one of those holy sisters that they so shamefully abuse in their
                    hellish publication. Would not their hearts fill with shame? No, these cowards
                    have neither shame nor honor within them.</p>
                <p> But to return to the Catholic chaplain, I should like to call the attention to
                    the good work done by him to the legislators and members of <ref
                        target="#boardofcontrol"> the board of control</ref>. Go and see for
                    yourselves, and ask yourselves, <said>"would it not be wise, would it not be a
                        good investment to appropriate sufficient funds to employ a paid Catholic
                        chaplain, that could live at the prison and devote his whole time to his
                        work?"</said> You will find that he can accomplish immeasurable good for the
                    reformation of character and maintainance of discipline. Other prisons have a
                    Catholic chaplain, why not Nebraska?</p>
                <p>The Protestant chaplain, who, by the way is also librarian and schoolmaster, as I
                    have stated, draws a salary of fifty dollars per month, which is really the
                    salary of a fifth-class preacher. Is it a wonder that such a specimen once in a
                    while drops into that office? My reader may say, <said>"Well, is not any old
                        preacher good enough for the convicts?"</said> and my answer is
                        <said>"NO,"</said> most emphatically <said>"NO."</said> This office,
                    although underpaid, is one of the most important offices in the state. No man
                    has a greater opportunity to do good, real good, than has this chaplain; no one
                    has greater opportunity to build up character than has he; no one can tear down
                    character and destroy discipline more than he can, if he is thus inclined. To
                    make a success, he should go hand in hand with the warden, and sustain him, no
                    matter what is the religion of the warden. If the chaplain works underhandedly
                    against the warden, my advice to the warden is to go and take out some life
                    insurance, and do so quickly, for it means good-bye to discipline and leaves the
                    road open to murder and riot. The chaplain should visit <emph
                        rend="case(allcaps)">all</emph> the boys on Sunday afternoon, and not spend
                    hours with one or two notorious, murderous <foreign xml:lang="es">desperadoes
                    </foreign>. He need not talk to them in modulated voice for there is no secret
                    to religion, and to religion only should he confine himself. He should not worry
                    over the funds or the condition of the funds and of the books, for there are
                    clerks to keep them and a warden to check the clerks, and again a state auditor
                    to check the warden. Nor should he worry how much each individual inmate has on
                    deposit, for they have earned it in the sweat of their brows and it is theirs
                    and theirs only. Should he discover any error on the part of the warden, would
                    it not be best for him to go direct to the warden, and talk it over, face to
                    face, man to man, instead of going around town and secretly, underhandedly
                    advertise some grievance or some imaginary grievance? To make a long story
                    short, he should remember that he is there as chaplain, not as warden. He should
                    attend to his own business only.</p>
                <p>The first chaplain that I knew at Lancaster was the <ref target="#huff">Reverend
                        James Huff</ref>, who served under <ref target="#smith"> Warden Smith</ref>.
                    The warden was a Catholic and the chaplain a Mormon, yet they worked hand in
                    hand and got along nicely. Good old <ref target="#huff">Chaplain Huff</ref> was
                    loved by all, officers, guards and inmates alike, for he was a good, sincere and
                    true man. Once in a while he would preach a Mormon sermon, and it would be
                    something new to the boys and they would enjoy it so much. I remember an inmate
                    by the name of <ref target="#murphy"> Murphy</ref>, who in his particular way
                    was a good fellow, yet was as rough as they make 'em. <ref target="#murphy">
                        Murphy</ref> believed not in heaven nor in hell and never spoke to the
                    chaplain. I was much surprised to see <ref target="#murphy"> Murphy</ref>
                    approach the chaplain one Sunday. This is what I heard him say: <said>"Doc, you
                        knows that I never bother any of you church people, and I ain't no saint,
                        nor do I profess to be one, see! But I am here to tell you that the sermon
                        you preached today about the Mormons and the guy with the eight wives, is
                        the best that was ever preached in this or any other penitentiary that I've
                        ever been at. Did you see some of them tough mugs sit up and take notice?
                        Like me, they never listened to the sermons before."</said></p>
                <p><said>"And did you see some of the girls from down Lincoln, how interested they
                        were? Chaplain, shake with me, and if ever I get religion, the Lord will
                        give you credit for it."</said>
                    <said>"Thank you, <ref target="#frank"> Frank</ref>,"</said> said the chaplain,
                        <said>"you are a young man, and you will come out all right yet."</said></p>
                <p><ref target="#huff"> Chaplain Huff</ref> had no desire to be the whole show, as
                    some chaplains have. No week passed by but what he looked for some good singers
                    and players to come to Lancaster and entertain the boys, and he brought out some
                    singers of great fame. Long will this good man be remembered at Lancaster. When
                    he said good-bye to his boys, there were tears in many eyes.</p>
                <p>The successor, to this splendid chaplain, was one <ref target="#johnson"> P. C.
                        Johnson of <ref target="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</ref></ref>, who had previously
                    served a term as chaplain at the prison. During my years among many people and
                    in many climes, I have become a judge of humanity and seldom do I misjudge a
                    man. I looked upon him for quite a while, but failed to find one trace of mercy,
                    love or kindness upon his stern old face. I shall say but little about him for I
                    am unable to report one real kind act on his part. I happened to think of my
                    boyhood days back east. Close to our home was a small lake surrounded by tall
                    elm trees. One, especially, was a large and beautiful tree and between that and
                    another, I put up my hammock. Lying in it one evening, I saw an unusual sight.
                    Floating in the lake was a twig of a tree, but it was floating up stream. How
                    could that be? I investigated and saw a large water rat underneath the twig. I
                    made a move, and the underhanded creature went to the bottom of the lake. I
                    thought but little more about it at that time, only that like these rats work
                    from cover, so do also some men work from under cover. Afterward there came a
                        <sic change="drouth">drought</sic>, and there was but little water in the
                    lake, soon the big tree commenced to lean forward and forward, and one morning
                    it fell into the lake. We found that a colony of large water rats had undermined
                    the tree. Now it lies dead and gone where once it stood in all its majestic
                    grandeur. I felt so sorry over the loss of the tree, for the landscape now
                    looked so strange to me: and I will leave it to my reader to imagine what my
                    feelings were towards the rats. While the rat covers his underhanded doings with
                    a twig, many a man covers up his underhanded deeds and uses for that the cover
                    of darkness, a coat of sanctimoniousness or any other cover necessary to gain
                    their underhanded points. If I have a grievance against a man, like a man I will
                    go to him and have a good heart to heart talk with him. In nine cases out of ten
                    the trouble will be adjusted. If I work in a public institution, and dislike the
                    religion, the personality or the methods of the head of the institution, why,
                    instead of doing the rat act, I will simply ask for my time check, for as <ref
                        target="#Poet">the poet</ref> says:</p>
                <p>
                    <quote>
                        <ref target="#Poet2"/>
                        <l>"Should we not like his company,</l>

                </p>
                <p>But I am getting away from my subject - the chaplain of the prison. Never once
                    did I know of him to approach <ref target="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</ref> and
                    in a friendly way talk matters over with him. While I knew that the warden was
                    not exactly going to turn his office over to him, yet if there was anything
                    within right or justice that he could have done for this man, I know that he
                    would have done it. One dreary January evening the warden was telling me how the
                    chaplain was working against him in an underhanded way. I asked: <said>"Well,
                        Warden, why does he not come to you and have a talk with you and state his
                        grievances?"</said> And the warden answered, <said>"Never once has he spoken
                        to me or made a complaint of any kind. Even in the dining room he does not
                        say a word; but never a week passes but what some of my friends tell me of
                        his underhanded work and warn me against him."</said></p>
                <p>There lives in Persia an animal having small, naked ears, four toes on each
                    foot,a straight jointed tail and erect hair on the neck. It is a fierce, cruel
                    and untamable animal. You have seen it in the menagerie, always nervous, always
                    restless, always shifting about. It is the hyena. As long as you live he will
                    never attack you; he will run away from you; but as soon as you are dead and in
                    your grave, he will sneak towards it under the cover of the night and devour
                    your dead body. I have known of a man doing the hyena act, by attacking a dead
                    man's honor after he is laid in his grave. I have known of a man doing this act
                    in one of our depots; and I know another, now in public office, who stepped
                    toward him and said: <said>"How would you like, when you are dead and gone, to
                        have me stand in a public place like this, and tell a bunch of men what I
                        know of you?"</said></p>

                    the officers and inmates; but he did come back. As he is a state official and a
                    public servant, would it not be interesting to the public at large to have him
                    explain where he was? When Jesus disappeared from his friends, he was found
                    praying within the temple. In what kind of a place was this reverend gentleman
                    found, and who found him? I happen to think of an old rhyme:</p>

                <p>I take much pleasure in telling you about an ideal prison chaplain. When the
                    governor had accepted Mr. Johnson's <soCalled>"resignation"</soCalled> he set
                    about to locate his successor. The governor moved slowly in this matter for he
                    realized how important it was to find the right sort of a man, a man who would
                    build up and not tear down, a man who would be a friend to all of the boys and
                    not to three or four <foreign xml:lang="es">desperadoes</foreign>, one who would
                    be chaplain and not attempt to be warden, a man who was a true Christian
                    gentleman, and not a hypocrite. Such a man was found in the person of <ref
                        target="#harmon"> Reverend Nathan T. Harmon</ref>, pastor of the <ref
                        target="#christianchurchdavidcity">Christian Church of <ref
                            target="#davidcity">David City</ref></ref> The governor had known him
                    for years, and had attended his church. On the following Sunday he. presented
                    his credentials to <ref target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</ref> and received
                    a hearty welcome. The new chaplain went into the church and soon the warden
                    followed. <said>"Warden,"</said> I said, <said>"are you not forgetting your
                        morning paper?"</said> The warden of the prison always attends church as a
                    precautionary measure; that is, he sits in the deputy warden's office in the
                    corner of the chapel. The warden always used to take with him a copy of the
                        <q>"Lincoln Sunday Star."</q>
                    <said>"No, my boy, this young preacher looks good to me and I am going to listen
                        to his sermon."</said> Like the warden, so did the boys also like the
                    chaplain, from the very start. <said>"How did you like the sermon?"</said> I
                    asked the warden. <said>"I liked every word of it. That man is made of the right
                        stuff,"</said> said the warden. <said>"He will do no underhanded work
                        against us."</said> In the afternoon the new chaplain went from cell to
                    cell. Some of the old timers, who used to feign sleep when the former chaplain
                    came around were at the door waiting to shake hands with their new friend.
                        <said>"Chaplain,"</said>said a long time holdup man, <said>"that sermon you
                        preached today went right to the hearts of us fellows. If I live eleven more
                        months I shall be a free man again and I am going to do what is
                        right."</said>
                    <said>"There is something to this chaplain that I like,"</said> said a life
                    timer to me. <said>"He preaches of the good and beautiful, about God and the
                        great home above us; and it sounds good, for we have had plenty of hell and
                        damnation for over a year."</said> Were I to chronicle here the many good
                    deeds done by <ref target="#harmon">Mr. Harmon</ref>, this book would be much
                    too small. Suffice it to say that he made friends with all the men and many a
                    soul was saved through his good work. When a year later another governor was
                    elected the boys were much worried over <ref target="#harmon">Mr. Harmon</ref>
                    losing his office, but their worries and suspense was turned to joy when the
                        <q>Star</q> announced his appointment as <ref target="#harmon">Deputy
                        Warden</ref> for they knew that he would continue to give them a square
                    deal; and so he did, and he turned out to be as successful and efficient a
                    deputy as the prison ever had.</p>

                <p>While the good work done among the prisoners by the true Christian men and women
                    is immeasurable, at the same time the work done by the ever increasing army of
                        <soCalled>"would-be reformers,"</soCalled> fake religionists, gushing
                    sentamentalists, female convict lovers and blabbering gossippers does more to
                    destroy the prison discipline than anything else and makes life an everlasting
                    burden for the prison officials and guards. <quote>"There is no doubt",</quote>
                    says a Clay county paper, <quote>"that the murder of the prison officials may be
                        traced to the unrest caused by the mistaken zeal of the 'alleged reformer'
                        who has been hounding the governor for the removal of the warden who laid
                        down his life in the service of the state."</quote> And the paper told the
                    truth. Likewise did the <q>"Lincoln Herald"</q>, a weekly that knows not what
                    fear is. The publisher was formerly a prison official and is in my opinion the
                    best posted newspaper man in the state as far as prison doings are concerned.
                    Time and time again he has called the public's attention to the menace of these
                    workers, and in the issue following the murder of the officials, says:
                        <quote>"The cruel murder of <ref target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</ref>,

                            Cellkeeper Doody</ref> at the state prison Thursday, is chargeable
                        directly and primarily to prison reformers, religionists and outside
                        influences, all of which destroys discipline and works a menace to the
                        prison officials."</quote> And the <q>"Lincoln Herald"</q> is right as it
                    always is. This paper always tells the truth. Its sympathies are with the under
                    dog, and as long as you are right this paper is with you and for you with all
                    its might; but if you are wrong, be you president or pauper, rich or poor, big
                    or small, it is likewise against you. When I received my <q>"Herald"</q> I read
                    this article to an official much in sympathy with the
                        <soCalled>"reformers,"</soCalled> not because they were
                        <soCalled>"reformers,"</soCalled> but because they were females (he was very
                    fond of the opposite sex), and said: <said>"There at least is one publisher who
                        has the nerve to tell the truth."</said>
                    <said> "Well,"</said> he drawled, <said>"that is only a little weekly and is not
                        in sympathy with the reform movement."</said>
                    <said> "No, you are right,"</said> I answered, <said>"it never was, and never
                        will be in sympathy with liars, hypocrites and murderers."</said> I sat down
                    and sent the publisher my check and asked to be notified when to renew, and as
                    long as I live I shall continue to subscribe for this noble paper. Now naturally
                    my reader will say, <said>"If these people are so destructive to prison
                        discipline, why does the warden permit them to come?"</said> I will tell you
                    why. This gang of <sic change="fakirs">fakers</sic> consists of about three fake
                    preachers or self-constituted evangelists, and seven or eight women. They
                    commenced to come to the prison several years ago, but under <ref
                        target="#beemer">Warden Beemer's</ref> administration they were much
                    restricted. When <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> took office this gang
                    held free sway and high carnival at the pen. Services over with they went to the
                    officers' dining room and were fed. From there they would go to the cell houses
                    and unrestricted visit from cell to cell. Is it a wonder that the prison was
                    full of <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled>? And did the prisoners appreciate these
                    women? Some much preferred after a week's hard work to take a rest on Sunday
                    afternoon. Others were much pleased to see these women come around, not because
                    they were soul savers, but because they were women. I will give you an
                    illustration. I passed one of these women on a gallery. She was a woman of
                    forty-five or fifty, no spring chicken by any means, yet she was dressed like a
                    seventeen-year-old. She was reading to a young man, a recent arrival, about the
                    prodigal son and the fatted calf. Was he interested? Yes, in a way; but as he
                    listened to her reading I noticed his eyes would rove toward a well turned ankle
                    clad in heliotrope hose. No matter how much she read about the prodigal, his
                    eyes would drift toward the ankle. And was he to blame? Man after all is but a
                    weak animal, and those poor penned-up boys are perhaps a little weaker than
                    their brothers on the outside. This boy had just arrived from a county jail,
                    where he had lain for weeks and had never seen or talked with a woman, and while
                    she was old enough to be his mother, he, like the sailor in mid-ocean to whom
                    any port looks good in a storm, became much interested in her, not because she
                    was reading the Bible to him, not because she was trying to save his soul, but
                    because she was a woman or as I should rather say--a female. And as he laid upon
                    his prison bed that afternoon, rolling to and fro, did he think of the prodigal
                    and the fatted calf? No, another calf was on his mind, a pretty one clad in
                    heliotrope. Lord, lead us not into temptation! And you women from <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln,</ref> I mean you curosity seekers, you who have
                    forty churches down town, but nevertheless have to come to the prison church,
                    don't put on your slit gowns. Make as little display of hose and ankles as
                    possible. Have a little mercy on those poor penned-up creatures out there. I
                    hope you see the point. The thoughts that these female
                        <soCalled>"reformers"</soCalled> and these female curosity seekers have
                    caused to come to the minds of the men out there have caused much misery and
                    suffering, especially to those with insufficient will power to control their
                    feelings, and made them into physical and mental wrecks. So, if you, my reader,
                    when standing upon the corner of Tenth and 0 streets should notice a thin and
                    haggard looking man, a discharged prisoner, alight from the
                        <soCalled>"penitentiary"</soCalled> car, do not blame his appearance to
                    being underfed or abused by the officials, for there is another reason.</p>
                <p>Gradually as the power of this gang increased the prison discipline decreased and
                    the penitentiary became the laughing stock of experienced prison men. Criminals
                    throughout the country referred to it as the <soCalled>"Playhouse",</soCalled>
                    the <soCalled>"Haven of Rest",</soCalled> or the
                        <soCalled>"Kindergarten."</soCalled>
                    <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> was fond of these
                        <soCalled>"reformers",</soCalled> for above all things he is a shrewd
                    politician and in his campaign for the governorship or for perpetual warden,
                    these women became very useful auxiliaries. For a fact, they circulated a
                    petition to the legislators to retain him, for well did they know that if <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</ref> was appointed warden there would be
                    no more dinners at the state's expense.</p>
                <p>Far more dangerous, far more poisonous than the sting of the rattler, is the
                    sting of the evil tongues; for while the sting of the snake is usually overcome
                    or cured, that of evil tongues may last a lifetime, may follow a person to his
                    grave. To these tattlers and meddlers, a man's integrity or a woman's honor
                    amounts to very little, just so that they gain their point. <ref target="#mason"

                <p>And I hope that Walt is right. Speaking about that place reminds me of a show I
                    saw at the <ref target="#majestic">"Majestic"</ref> in Chicago a few years ago,
                    entitled <title type="play">"The Devil and Tom Walker."</title> That show caused
                    me to stop, ponder and reflect. It set me to studying more than if all the
                    preachers in our city would preach to me for years to come. Before you is a
                    subterranean grotto, representing hades, fire and sulphur sparks flying in all
                    directions. A new arrival comes sliding down a shute. It is a negro, Mr. Tom
                    Walker, from Memphis, Tennessee. Tom is thirsty and grabs a schooner, but
                    instead of beer out comes burning flames. <quote>"Tom," says the devil, "I am
                        going down on earth, and I am going to put you in charge while I am gone."
                        "Before you go, Mr. Devil, just tell me one thing. Billy Williams, our
                        sheriff was sick when I left the earth; has he come here yet?" "No, but I
                        look for him here today," says the king of hades, "and I wish you would take
                        good care of him." "Indeed I shall," says Tommy, "he has arrested me so
                        often for shooting craps that I shall give him special attention." Satan
                        departs and Tom turns to a little female imp and asks, "Which is the worst
                        department in this place." "Ah, the skunk oil bath," she says.</quote> Soon
                    the sheriff arrives, is promptly set over there, and you hear him groan when the
                    imps of hell tickle his ribs with their pronged forks. That picture often comes
                    back to my memory and I think there would be no better place for those
                    hypocrites who, with their lying, poisonous tongues and underhanded work, caused
                    the death of four of our brave prison officials. If a warden objects to these
                    people and their methods, the <soCalled>"gang"</soCalled> will call upon the
                    governor or the state officials and tell what a wicked sinner, what an infidel,
                    what a monster the warden is, and that he ought to be removed. If the governor
                    has too much sense to pay attention to these <sic change="fakirs">fakers</sic>
                    why, then there is another way, the way used on that fatal day of February and
                    again on that wintry day of March - bloody murder.</p>
                <p>I must also introduce you to another specimen of the same tribe, less numerous,
                    but not less poisonous. These are the long distance reformers, by themselves
                    called <soCalled>"prison experts";</soCalled> and some of them even call
                    themselves <soCalled>"international prison experts."</soCalled> The funny part
                    of it is that none of them were ever connected with a prison. They live an easy
                    life and their graft is a good one. They sit in their home, usually in some
                    large eastern city, and write articles about prison reform and prisons, yet they
                    never saw the prisons they write about. For the benefit of my readers, as well
                    as for the benefit of the publishers who are foolish enough to accept their
                    slush as the truth, and publish it, I will show how they work. The
                        <soCalled>"expert"</soCalled> sits down and writes to every prison warden
                    for his latest report. Every prison publishes such a report every two years.
                    There is much good reading in them, and many illustrations. They show the
                    progress made at the prison since the last report was published. With these
                    reports before him, it is easy enough for the <soCalled>"expert"</soCalled> to
                    build a magazine article, which he trims with a liberal amount of hot air, which
                    he did not have to send away for. Then he catches a publisher. It is a pity that
                    two of our leading magazines within the last year have been caught by one of
                    these sharks. The publisher prints this stuff, the public reads it and condemns
                    the management of the prison. If you tell them that it is not the truth, the
                    answer will be: <q>"It must be the truth, for don't you see it was written by a
                        'prison expert"'?</q></p>
                <p>I have never been much in favor of sending stuff to these fellows, but as one of
                    them kept on writing me I finally sat down one evening and worked until midnight
                    to get together the information he asked for. While he gets fancy prices from
                    the publishers, yet he never saw fit to waste a stamp on me to acknowledge
                    receipt of my letters. After waiting a month I wrote him and asked if he had
                    received it. The following letter was received which speaks for itself, and
                    exposes the methods of these men:</p>

                        <p>DEAR SIR: I have yours of the 24th and beg to apologize most profoundly
                            for my failure to acknowledge receipt of your earlier letters and
                            clippings. The delay was due to the very interesting nature of the
                            material, the hurried reading of which raised so many questions in my
                            mind that I was impelled to put the matter aside until I should have had
                            full opportunity to give it the careful reading that it deserved and to
                            put to you the questions that occurred to me. Unfortunately I have been
                            so rushed with a variety of other matters that the opportunity longed
                            for has not yet arrived. I shall limit myself to a hasty and apologetic
                            acknowledgement, and to the expression of the hope that you will
                            continue to send me such information as you may deem it of importance
                            for me to possess.</p>

                        <closer><salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

                <p>This is the same <soCalled>"expert"</soCalled> who wrote those blood and thunder
                    articles in two of our leading magazines a few months ago. You see now how he
                    gets his material. The original of this letter is on file in my office and any
                    of my readers are welcome to call and see it. I wish to inform my readers that
                    there is as much difference between the real conditions and those described by
                    this <soCalled>"expert"</soCalled> as there is between the glorious sun and a
                    coal oil lamp. Some of his stuff is the truth in a way-that is, it happened
                    twenty years ago but does not happen now.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the outbreak the prison was honored by a visit from one of this
                    style of gentry, one <ref target="#gtaylor">Graham Taylor,</ref> who with a
                    bunch of old women edits a little magazine for the betterment of mankind at
                    Chicago.</p>
                <p>He came here to gather material for some articles for this publication.
                        <said>"Would his excellency, the governor, kindly give him a permit to see
                        the prison from start to finish?"</said> Certainly our courteous and
                    gentlemanly governor would grant this <soCalled>"international
                        expert"</soCalled> a pass. So we showed him all there was to be seen. He
                    went away stating that the place was not as black as it had been painted and
                    that while there was room for many improvements, yet everything was as,
                    satisfactory as it could be under the circumstances. Imagine our surprise when
                    the next morning there was an interview in a morning paper quite to the
                    contrary. The governor called the <soCalled>"expert"</soCalled> upon the carpet
                    to explain and it was the same old story. <said>"Why, the reporters have not
                        quoted me correctly."</said> Charity, as I have said before, begins at home.
                        <ref target="#gtaylor">Mr. Taylor </ref>, why not clean up the slums of your
                    own city, why not go after the vice and the white slavers in Chicago first and
                    drive them out of the windy city; and when you have accomplished that, then come
                    back to Nebraska and clean up here? Until you have done that, we can perhaps get
                    along without you. Another <soCalled>"expert,"</soCalled> a regular old wolf in
                    garb of a sheep, used to come to the prison. Every courtesy was shown him,
                    because we took him to be a sincere and good man. Much to our surprise, there
                    appeared in an Omaha paper an interview with him, stating that convicts were
                    underfed and that the meat served was unfit to eat, while those inmates who had
                    money, bought from the prison meat cutter the fancy slices and cooked them in
                    their cells. Soon our friend came to Lancaster. It was time for luncheon (those
                    people usually happen around about meal time) and Steward Robb and our reformer
                    went to luncheon together. Mr. Robb kept calling for me and I joined the two.
                    There was a twinkle in Mr. Robb's eye and I knew that something was going to
                    happen. I awaited developments. The luncheon was served. The prison meat cutter
                    dressed in spotless white served as waiter. <said>"How about that interview the
                        other day?"</said> said Mr. Robb. <said>"Well I did not refer to this
                        administration,"</said> said the reformer, <said>"I meant the Delahunty
                        administration."</said>
                    <said>"Well,"</said> said I, <said>"there is where you and I collide, for that
                        brave man lies in his grave and I will answer for him and protect him
                        against such willful, malicious and uncalled for lies; furthermore, this man
                        who is waiting on our table has been the prison meat cutter for over
                        thirteen years. He is serving a life sentence and is trying for a pardon. Do
                        you realize the injustice your Particle does to this poor man?"</said> Our
                    friend replied, <said>"The fact of the matter is that the reporters either
                        misquoted or misunderstood me."</said> For a few, minutes he squirmed in his
                    seat, then he pulled out his watch and said, <said>"Well, I must hurry to get my
                        car. So long, gentlemen."</said> This religious gentleman stays at the Y. M.
                    C. A. in Omaha, except when he is out begging the good people in Nebraska for
                    money with which to carry on his soul saving work. I warn people against
                    contributing to these grafters. If you have money to give to sweet charity, give
                    it to the poor in your own town; or if you wish to benefit the boys in prison,
                    contribute to the <ref target="#nebraskaprisonassociation">Nebraska Prison
                        Association,</ref> Little Block, Lincoln, Nebraska, an association that is
                    genuine and does much good. Stay away from these traveling grafters, no matter
                    what name they work under and no matter if they do come to your church and get
                    permission from your minister to preach there, for while your pastor is sincere,
                    the grafter is not. Leave them alone. Another specimen of this same kind, has
                    come to the prison for years and has had access to the books, from which he
                    copied the names of the inmates as well as their friends. He is a sanctimonious
                    looking fellow, always ready to shake hands and call you
                        <soCalled>"brother."</soCalled> Shortly after I took office, he came, and as
                    usual entered the vault and took out the descriptive ledger. I watched him for a
                    minute and saw him take down names in shorthand. Is it not nerve, to go into a
                    public office and take out the books without even asking, and does it not show
                    underhandedness to copy in shorthand? So I said, <said>"What is that you are
                        copying there?"</said>
                    <said> "Brother, I am just copying a few names."</said>
                    <said>"Do you copy the names of all the prisoners, and why do you copy the names
                        of their friends?"</said> I asked. <said>"Well brother, I just do as the
                        Lord dictates me to do."</said>
                    <said>"Well,"</said> said I, <said>"the Lord dictates to me that you are never
                        to copy any more names as long as I am in charge."</said> He did not like
                    it. While the inmates' names, their sentences, and their crimes, are public
                    records, the names of their parents, brothers, sisters and friends' are not
                    public property, and I look upon this as a sacred matter and felt it my duty to
                    protect these people against being preyed upon by these wolves. I know of a case
                    where a young man was sent to prison from the central part of the state. His
                    mother was well to do. Soon she received a letter from one of these people
                    stating that he could perhaps get the boy out of prison. She sent the
                        <soCalled>"soulsavers"</soCalled> twenty dollars, yet the boy served his
                    year. Since then I have incurred the wrath of this worthy gentleman as well as
                    that of the gang of <soCalled>"soulsavers"</soCalled> who make their
                    headquarters at the Ninth Street Mission in Lincoln. According to them, I am the
                    wickedest sinner in the city, and while I acknowledge that I have been a sinner
                    in my days, I feel now that I will sit as close to the throne as any of these
                    holy ones.</p>

                <p>And before they start out to purify our institutions, let them clean their own,
                    for I think that a little house cleaning would do this religious joint a world
                    of good. On the second story of this mission are rooms for their converts. A
                    young grass-widow whose soul was saved occupied one, and an officer of the
                    mission another. It appears that the officer made a date with the grass-widow to
                    call upon him in his room. Later it seems that the lady took a fancy to someone
                    else, so the officer in the middle of the night slips over to the police
                    station. There is a raid, and the widow and her friend are taken to the station.
                    In the police court the next morning, the woman broke down and cried and was
                    turned loose while the gentleman was fined. Let us hope that these people give
                    more of their time to clean their own place. The trouble of it is, that some of
                    them are so busy looking after other peoples' affairs that they completely
                    forget their own. So busy is one woman reformer with saving souls of the
                    convicts that she had not had time to wash her own face for some time; while
                    another has not taken a bath for a long time, but drowns the odors of her body
                    in stale perfume, Can a clean soul live in a filthy body?</p>

                <p>Nebraska penitentiary has had its share of criminals of fame and also some
                    peculiar characters. Years ago when the territory of Wyoming sent their
                    prisoners here, they sent a <ref target="#chinaman">Chinaman,</ref> who by the
                    way, was the only Chinese ever received here. Shortly before his time expired,
                    another prisoner slipped up behind him and cut off his queue. <ref
                        target="#annie">"Morphine Annie"</ref> was also a guest of the institution
                    some years ago. On the outside she was a snake charmer of some reputation. One
                    of the most unruly women ever received was <ref target="#bertha">"Fainting
                        Bertha,"</ref> who has served in many prisons and was once a beautiful
                    woman, but much <soCalled>"dope"</soCalled> and many years behind the bars have
                    caused <ref target="#bertha">Bertha's</ref> beauty to fade away. Her method was
                    to locate a gentleman with a diamond stud. She would stumble against him, act as
                    if she was fainting and in some way get his diamond. As soon as she got the
                    stone, she revived. <ref target="#bertha">Bertha</ref> played her last trick of
                    that kind, in Lincoln and received a sentence of five years. Shortly after
                    coming to the pen, she became unmanageable and was put into a room by herself.
                    This did not suit <ref target="#bertha">Bertha;</ref> she sent for the warden
                    and told him that she was going to tear the sheets to pieces and hang herself.
                    She was then locked up in the bath room; but soon she notified the warden that
                    she was going to drown herself in the bath tub. She was then taken to the <ref

                        >Hastings,</ref> where she lingers now. Some years ago <ref target="#martin"
                        >"Bert" Martin</ref> was received here from <ref target="#keyapahacounty"
                        >Keya Paha county</ref> for horse stealing. <soCalled>"He"</soCalled> came
                    in men's clothes, was supposed to be a man and remained for seven months in the
                    men's cell building until a jealous inmate went to the warden and reported <ref
                        target="#martin">"Bert"</ref> to be a woman in man's attire. <ref
                        target="#martin">"Bert"</ref> had won the love of many of the boys, even of
                    one of the guards, and among the many admirers had rejected the one who
                        <soCalled>"squealed."</soCalled> The prison physician was called in and
                    examined <ref target="#martin">"Bert,"</ref> and found him to be a person
                    possessed of both sexes. It was thought best to transfer <ref target="#martin"
                        >"Bert"</ref> to the female department; but up there the same story repeated
                    itself. All the girls fell in love with <ref target="#martin">"Bert"</ref> and
                    there was much hair pulling and many fights for possession of
                        <soCalled>"him"</soCalled> or <soCalled>"her,"</soCalled> or whatever would
                    be proper to say. Finally <ref target="#savage">Governor Savage</ref> was called
                    upon for assistance and he pardoned the prisoner.</p>
                <p>Recently there was received into the prison one <ref target="#willoughby">Bertie
                        Jessie Lee Willoughby</ref>, from Omaha, for grand larceny. This young
                    fellow had a smooth face and looked, talked and walked like a woman, and was an
                    expert at fancy needle work. He became a trusty and worked about the officer's
                    rooms. One afternoon he donned a suit of pale blue silk underwear belonging to
                        <ref target="#humphrey">Doctor Humphrey,</ref> the assistant surgeon. The
                    suit was sent the <ref target="#humphrey">Doctor</ref> by a college chum who
                    toured the Asiatic countries and brought it from China. He then put on a suit of
                    clothes belonging to <ref target="#robb"> Steward Robb,</ref> appropriated my
                    overcoat, walked out of the prison and took a car for the city where he caught a
                    freight train for Fairbury and disappeared into Kansas. We afterwards learned
                    that he had served in several other pens and was wanted by the federal
                    authorities for desertion from the navy and also for forgery in St. Louis. He is
                    in the west at the present time and some day he will be brought back.</p>
                <p>Another notable was <ref target="#vonwerner">"Count" Max von Werner,</ref>
                    claiming to be a scion of a noble German family. He was sent from Madison for
                    obtaining money under false pretenses, and was to serve from one to five years.
                    He was a very accomplished musician and soon gained the confidence of the
                    officers, all except one, myself; for never did I believe that he was a
                        <soCalled>"Count,"</soCalled> nor that he was a university graduate. It
                    happened that</p>

                <p><ref target="#johnson">Chaplain P. C. Johnson</ref> who lives at Tecumseh asked
                    of <ref target="#fenton">Warden Fenton</ref> permission to take the
                        <soCalled>"Count"</soCalled> home with him, that he might entertain some of
                    his friends with choice music. The warden did not like it, and refused several
                    times, but finally, upon the pleadings of the chaplain, permitted him to go.
                    They left the prison on Monday morning and were to return on Friday evening. The
                        <soCalled>"Count"</soCalled> took a good rest at Tecumseh, and on Thursday
                    night got up and took the midnight train for Saint Joseph, Missouri. Here he
                    pawned his cornet and took a car for Kansas City where he pawned his violin, and
                    for a few days we lost track of him. In the meantime <ref target="#fenton"
                        >Warden Fenton</ref> got busy and sent the <soCalled>"Count's"</soCalled>
                    picture to every sheriff in the country. Soon we learned that he had gone to
                    Spirit Lake, Iowa, where he had bought out a store for $4,970.00, tendered a
                    check for $5,000.00 and received the balance of thirty dollars in cash. He also
                    bought a suit of clothes from a storekeeper and paid with a forty-dollar check.
                    Then he skipped the town and for several weeks we did not hear anything about
                    him. One day a wire came from Sheriff Henderson at Woodstock, Illinois, who had
                    him in custody. He had tried to cash a check in that city, but the sheriff was
                    too quick for him and landed him in jail. In the meantime, we learned that this
                    blue blooded gentleman was a graduate from seven penitentiaries, and was wanted
                    by the reformatory at Mansfield, Ohio, where he will go when his five years in
                    this prison expire. As he has ten years to serve there and several charges
                    against him in Iowa and Illinois the <soCalled>"Count's"</soCalled> future is
                    not altogether a pleasant one. But then he is used to it and seems to prefer
                    life behind the bars to life on the outside. He is also an artist, but as such
                    he is a rank failure. He painted a picture of a landscape, a duck is flying
                    across a stream, but the duck is much larger than the mountain in the picture.
                    On another picture is a lion and a dog, but the dog looks more like a giraffe
                    than a dog and it is a mighty fierce looking lion. The boys at Lancaster were
                    glad to hear of him being caught. One of them wrote the following rhyme about
                    him:</p>

                        <l>Where they petted him and humored him</l>

                <p>There lingers in Lancaster a young colored man, number 4585, who paints in oil
                    and water color both. He has painted some beautiful portraits, and if any of my
                    readers would like a portrait painted, it would be well to get the warden's
                    permission to have him paint you one. Another genius is out there, he is a
                    cartoonist, one of the best in the country, <ref target="#naylor"> Mr.
                        Naylor.</ref> The front and back covers of this book were drawn by him in a
                    few minutes. I hope some newspaper will get in touch with him and give him a
                    position.</p>
                <p>Another notable guest lives at Lancaster, namely <ref target="#stclair"> George
                        St. Clair,</ref> but he is not as much of a saint as the name would
                    indicate. <ref target="#stclair"> Mr. St. Clair</ref> was sent up to serve from
                    one to seven years for stealing a bolt of silk from a Lincoln department store.
                    From the start he refused to attend church services, claiming that it was
                    against his religious belief. Being asked what religion he professed, he said
                    that he was a Jew. We called up the Rabbi and had a talk with him about it. The
                    Rabbi suggested that he be a good boy and go to church, and that there was
                    nothing wrong in so doing. Still <ref target="#stclair"> St. Clair</ref> refused
                    and it was decided to place him in a dark cell every Sunday during church hours
                    until he decided to go to church; but he evidently preferred the dark cell to
                    the Reverend <ref target="#chaplainjohnson">Johnson's</ref> sermons and kept on
                    refusing to go to church. He also wrote a letter to the attorney general and the
                    chief justice of the supreme court, and both of these gentlemen wrote him a
                    courteous letter as private individuals and advised him to obey the prison
                    rules. Even that did not satisfy him, he became more and more unruly and
                    disobedient and is now kept in a dark cell all the time. And what has he gained?
                    He has gained exactly what he sought for, namely, a lot of newspaper notoriety
                    which will do him no good. It is astonishing what some people will do in order
                    to get their names into print. Had he acted like a man, he no doubt would have
                    been paroled when he had served ten months; as it is now, he will perhaps remain
                    at the prison for seven years.</p>

                <head type="title">ESCAPES FROM THE PRISON </head>

                <p>Every once in a while a prisoner makes his escape from the prison. Altogether one
                    hundred and eight have escaped since its establishment in 1869. The first to
                    escape was <ref target="#hogan">James Hogan</ref> who made his
                        <soCalled>"getaway"</soCalled> way back in 1871 and was never heard of
                    since. It seems almost impossible that one man could escape three times,
                    nevertheless that was the case of <ref target="#cwilliams">Charles
                        Williams,</ref> alias Jacobson. <ref target="#cwilliams">Charley</ref> was
                    recaptured twice and was again placed as a trusty in the prison garden after
                    having given <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> his word of honor that he
                    would never again attempt to escape. <ref target="#cwilliams">Charley</ref>
                    worked a few days in the garden, then under cover of the fruit trees reached the
                    railroad track and again departed for parts unknown. This time he was not
                    recaptured. This was <ref target="#cwilliams">Charley's</ref> third trip to
                    Lancaster and we afterwards learned that he was wanted in four different places;
                    so could you blame him for taking French leave? During the administration of
                        <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> thirteen, altogether, left without
                    leaving their forwarding address. Of these thirteen nine were trusties, who
                    either scaled the wall or walked off, and four sawed their way to sweet liberty.
                    These four were cooks and flunkies in the guards' dining room and went to work
                    about four o'clock in the morning before any guards were on duty in that part of
                    the building. They would utilize the early morning hours for sawing the bars a
                    little now and a little then. They would carefully conceal the sawing by
                    covering it with soft soap of the color of the bars. On a Sunday morning early,
                    and before the warden and guards were out of bed, they quietly removed the cut
                    bars and jumped out upon the lawn in front of the prison. They have never been
                    heard of since. An hour later a guard came in and wanted his breakfast, but
                    there was no fire in the stove and no cooks. He promptly gave the alarm and a
                    posse was sent out, but without results. The papers stated that most of the
                    sawing was done from the outside, but this is most ridiculous. During <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty's</ref> administration five escaped,
                    one from the farm, and one from the warehouse outside the walls. The latter soon
                    came back from Omaha with a ten year sentence for another crime, and when this
                    is finished he will start in and complete his first sentence. The other three
                    dynamited and shot their way out, but one was shot dead by the sheriff's posse,
                    one committed suicide and the third was captured and given a life sentence.
                    During <ref target="#melick">Warden Melick's</ref> administration there were no
                    outbreaks. Ten trusties took French leave, but five of these were recaptured
                    within a few hours of their escape.</p>
                <p>It is strange, but nevertheless it is true, that these men who have the shortest
                    sentences are the ones that usually escape.As <ref target="#pinker">William
                        Pinkerton,</ref> the great detective says: <quote>"When a tramp hears the
                        whistle of the locomotive he cannot resist. He must travel."</quote> The
                    five who were not recaptured were all floaters or tramps, who had no home
                    anywhere, and whose sentences were very short, several of them having less than
                    ninety days.</p>
                <p>During <ref target="#fenton">Warden Fenton's</ref> administration and up to this
                    day there has been only one escape, and he fiddled his way out. He was turned
                    over to the chaplain, who lives at Tecumseh. He entertained a party of the
                    chaplain's friends one night with sweet strains from his violin. He played until
                    late in the night and wound up his entertainment with the music from the old
                    familiar song <title type="song">"I Am Going Far Away."</title> He made his good
                    night bow to the audience, retired to his room, and when everything was quiet,
                    departed for parts unknown. The next morning the chaplain knocked upon his door
                    to tell him that break-fast was ready, but the <ref target="#vonwerner">"Count"
                    </ref> was not there. The news was telephoned to <ref target="#fenton">Warden
                        Fenton,</ref> who got busy and sent the nobleman's photo broadcast. Now if
                    the <ref target="#vonwerner">"Count"</ref> had followed the straight and narrow
                    path and gone to work in some small town, perhaps he never would have been
                    caught, but alas, he cannot dispense with lying or crooked work. From town to
                    town he went, hiring automobiles and paying for them with bad checks. He was
                    just getting into a ear at Woodstock, Illinois, ready to go to Chicago, after
                    cashing a bad check for thirty dollars, but he forgot to pay his hotel bill, and
                    the proprietor called in Sheriff Henderson. The sheriff, who had the circular
                    sent out by <ref target="#fenton">Warden Fenton,</ref> immediately recognized
                    the nobleman, and wired to the warden. Thus ended the check-passing expedition
                    of the <ref target="#vonwerner">"Count"</ref> for many years. It cost the prison
                    about ninety dollars for stamps and circulars and fifty dollars reward for his
                    capture, besides forty-nine dollars railroad fare to bring him back, a total of
                    $189.00. As there is a law upon our statutes that an officer is responsible for
                    the escape of a convict, the expense of recapturing him is to be paid by this
                    officer: and our chaplain, who is very conscientious will no doubt pay the
                    state. Those who like music, should be willing to pay the fiddler, but it would
                    perhaps be cheaper to hire an orchestra or a band than this one violinist.</p>

                <head type="title">HOW TO GET OUT OF PRISON </head>

                <p>I mean by the title of this chapter, how to get out legitimately and not by the
                        <ref target="#vonwerner">von Werner</ref> method. This is the way: be a good
                    fellow, obey the rules, attend to your own business, and before long the prison
                    gates will open for you. Show the world that you are a man even though you are
                    in prison. Nebraska has just adopted the indeterminate sentence and the parole
                    law, and under these laws the judge shall sentence a convict prisoner (except
                    those convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping and treason, whose sentence is
                    affixed by the judge) to the penitentiary, but he shall not affix the duration
                    of the sentence. That is left for the board of pardons and parole to do. And a
                    wise and good law indeed is the indeterminate sentence law. Under the old system
                    I have seen prisoners arrive at Lancaster on the same day and for the same
                    crime, one with a short sentence and one with a long sentence. On the same day
                    and on the same train once, but from two different counties, there came a man
                    with a five year sentence for stealing a heifer and one with a two years
                    sentence for stealing a team. This is how it used to be. Judge Jones gets up on
                    the wrong side of the bed, and feels badly and out of sorts. He proceeds to
                    court and there stands a man ready to be sentenced to the penitentiary.
                        <said>"Ten years,"</said> says the judge. The poor fellow goes up for ten
                    years. Now there is Judge Smith, in another county. He gets up on the right side
                    of the bed, and on this morning everything looks sweet and good to him.
                        <said>"One year,"</said> says he. <said>"Go down and be a man and earn two
                        months good time."</said> In other words the judges, like the prisoners, and
                    all the rest of us, have a temper of their own. I recall an instance where a
                    prisoner stood before the judge ready to be sentenced. <said>"Four years"</said>
                    says the judge. <said>"What, four years for a little thing like that?"</said>
                    says the prisoner. <said>"Give him another year Mr. Clerk,"</said> says the
                    judge. The prisoner again tries to argue with the judge and the judge turns to
                    the clerk and adds another year. By this time the boy realizes that it does not
                    pay to talk back to the judge, and he starts for Lancaster. Here he remains for
                    three years, is paroled, and at this writing is doing nicely. And I have seen on
                    the same day, a man come to Lancaster for one year for manslaughter, and another
                    man with three years for stealing a suit of overalls and a pair of shoes. I know
                    of one district where the judge possesses a heart and soul and is inclined
                    toward the minimum; while another judge generally approaches the maximum
                    sentence; <said>"and"</said> he adds, while chewing a big chunk of tobacco,
                        <said>"I am sorry I cannot give you more!"</said> I often wonder if that
                    judge ever thought of the hereafter and of the day when he himself has to stand
                    before that great Judge to Whom all sinners look alike. Under this old law a
                    prisoner or a bunch of prisoners were brought before the judge to be sentenced.
                    He never knew them, never saw them before, perhaps he will never see them again.
                    He sentences each as he sees fit, as he feels on that morning, and he knows not
                    when that particular prisoner will be a fit subject to turn loose upon society
                    again. Under the new law the judge sentences the prisoner to the penitentiary,

                <p>The prisoner arrives at the penitentiary and meets the warden and the deputy
                    warden. As the days go by these gentlemen learn of his character and habits, of
                    his strong and his weak points, of his capacity of self control, and they make
                    their reports to the board accordingly. When nine months pass by he is given an
                    application blank to fill out. In this he sets forth the history of his life,
                    the details of the crime, the causes leading to it and names of responsible
                    parties for references. This blank then goes to the <ref
                        target="#boardofpardonsandparole"> board of pardons and parole.</ref> The
                    board consists of three splendid gentlemen, Hon. John O. Yeiser, of Omaha, Hon.
                    Edward G. Maggi of Lincoln, and Doctor J. S. Butler of Superior. Hon. J. A.
                    Piper of Lincoln is the secretary of the board. If <ref target="#aldrich"
                        >Governor Aldrich</ref> had searched the world over he could not have found
                    four better men, nor four men better adapted for this work than these four. They
                    have taken a deep interest in the welfare of the inmates and have done a world
                    of good, not only for them but for society at large. As I have worked together
                    with them I have come to love and admire them for their many sterling qualities
                    and for their earnest and conscientious work. It is with much regret that I
                    learn of Doctor Butler not being reappointed by <ref target="#morehead">
                        Governor Morehead,</ref> but being a republican he must make room for a
                    democrat. His successor is Doctor Talcott, of Crofton. This gentleman looks good
                    to me, and for the boys' sake, I hope that he will turn out to be as just as his
                    predecessor. I also learn, just as this book goes to press that Mr. Piper is to
                    retire soon to go into business for himself. This is indeed much to be
                    regretted, for Mr. Piper took great interest in his work and was well adapted
                    for it. The officers and inmates all like Mr. Piper for he is possessed of the
                    sunniest disposition, and sees everything from the bright side. Fortunately for
                    the state as well as for the boys in gray, Mr. Yeiser and Mr. Maggi hold office
                    for several years, and it will take a republican governor to remove them. Mr.
                    Yeiser may, however, become a candidate for the nomination for governor, and if
                    nominated, the business men, as well as the laboring men, who love him for his
                    good work, will land him in the governor's chair.</p>
                <p>When a prisoner has been in the penitentiary for ten months, he is given a
                    hearing before the board. From the warden and his deputy comes a report of the
                    prisoner's behavior; from the prosecuting attorney and the judge comes another
                    report as to the crime and all that they know of the prisoner; from the parole
                    application comes the story as told by the prisoner himself, and from his
                    references comes more information as to his past. The board is now prepared to
                    deal with him and he is called to the prison library where the board meets once
                    a month. It matters not to the board nor to the prisoner whether he is rich or
                    poor, influential or unknown, he is treated according to the merits of his case.
                    If after cross-questioning him and the answers are not satisfactory, or if some
                    more information is needed, his case is continued to another meeting of the
                    board; but if everything is satisfactory he is granted a parole. In no case does
                    the board use undue haste but exercises much deliberation. If a parole is
                    granted, a set of parole papers is drawn up which the prisoner signs. He agrees
                    to remain away from saloons, pool halls, places of ill repute, to shun bad
                    company and to go to church. He agrees to report to the board once a month as to
                    how many days work he has done, how much earned and how much expended and how
                    expended, what periodicals he has read, what articles impressed him the most,
                    and what church he has attended. He must have an employer who signs an agreement
                    to see that he does not keep bad company, or in other words agrees to be like an
                    elder brother to him. Often when the boys are strangers in the state and without
                    any friends, they have no one to sign their parole and put them to work. I have
                    found employment for a score or more of these boys, and they have promised me
                    upon leaving to go out and do, right. With one exception they all made good and
                    are today respected citizens, an ornament to their community. Does not this
                    system appeal to my reader? Is it not far better to send these men out into
                    society when they are fit to enter society, than to have a judge give them a
                    certain fixed sentence? Nearly all of the paroled men make good, and from
                    observation I have learned that the indeterminate sentence law and the parole
                    law are of immeasurable benefit not only to the men themselves in returning them
                    to manhood, but to the state as well in safeguarding and protecting its
                    citizens.</p>

                <head type="chapter"> CHAPTER SIXTEEN</head>
                <head type="title">NEBRASKA'S DISGRACE </head>

                <p>In this chapter I tell my reader of a great injustice, of a disgrace to our
                    state. If a man has served a sentence in prison, no matter how long, he is upon
                    his discharge, given a six-dollar suit of clothes, a fifty-cent shirt, a cheap
                    suit of underwear, a two-dollar pair of shoes, a dollar hat, and five dollars in
                    money. It matters not how cold it is, he gets no overcoat; nor does it matter
                    were he was sentenced from, five dollars is all he gets, and if that will not
                    buy his ticket home he will have to walk or fly, or get there in some other way.
                    From the minute he boards the car at Lancaster he is known by his clothes as a
                    discharged convict. Police officers keep their eyes upon him. When in prison
                    everything was furnished, but now he has to look out for something to eat and a
                    place to sleep. Before long his five dollars are gone. What will he do then? Is
                    he much to blame if he, unable to get work, commits another crime? Is not the
                    state, in an indirect way, a party to the crime? Two years ago the legislature
                    passed a law to give the outgoing prisoner ten dollars, but unfortunately they
                    overlooked to appropriate funds for that purpose, thus the law was of no value.'
                    It reminds me of a friend of mine, who was quite a hunter. He invited me up to
                    his house to take dinner with him. He had shot a young, wild goose' and his good
                    wife was preparing it for us. Long before we came to the house we smelled the
                    goose cooking. While his wife was not looking, his neighbor's dog got the goose,
                    much to our disappointment. Well, we managed to get along anyhow. It is the same
                    way with the, boys of Lancaster. They had heard so much of the ten dollar bill
                    they were to get and they saw the law enacted; but they never got the ten, they
                    got only the smell of it, and they, too, had to get along somehow with the five
                    only. And again at the 1913 session of the legislature, it went the same way. I
                    made several trips to the state house and conferred with several senators. Some
                    of them were surprised over existing conditions. Only one knew all about it;
                    that was Senator Dodge of Omaha. The senators promised that they would do all in
                    their power in this matter and they kept their promise; but someway, somehow,
                    the bill went astray in the house, and again no appropriation. One good thing,
                    however, about those sterling patriots who serve in our legislatures-they never
                    forget to appropriate funds for their own salaries. That is usually the first
                    number on the program, and not only is it the first, but is passed with an
                    emergency clause, that those good solons will not have to wait for their
                    hard-earned money. I will ask my reader, <q>"What is the best for the state, as
                        well as the cheapest in the long run-to give the outgoing boys five dollars
                        and the cheap clothes, and then have many of them come back again as a ward
                        of the state; or give them a decent suit of clothes, a ticket to their home,
                        and ten dollars in cash?"</q> Believe me, the latter is the cheapest to the
                    tax payers in the long run. Now all of this refers to the discharged convict
                    only, not to those paroled, for they get-nothing at all. Sometimes his employer
                    brings him clothes, sometimes the prison officials or his friends get clothes
                    for him; and sometimes the suit of an incoming prisoner is given to him;
                    sometimes he is turned out into the world in his convict garb. That is what I
                    call Nebraska's disgrace. Think of it my reader - to turn a man out in the gray
                    prison suits worn at Lancaster! Certainly steps ought to be taken to prevent
                    this. All the friends of the boys in gray should come to the state house and do
                    all they can to have such a law enacted, and see that funds are appropriated for
                    this purpose. To properly equip the outgoing prisoners, I refer to the
                    legislative recommendation of <ref target="#melick">Warden Melick</ref> - to
                    furnish them with ten dollars in money, a ticket to where they were sent from or
                    any other place of equal distance, an overcoat during the fall and winter
                    months, and decent clothes such as will not advertise him to all citizens of
                    Lincoln and to every officer throughout the state.</p>

                <p>Much as the prisoner likes company, yet there is some company that he would
                    rather dispense with. Uninvited they come to the cells and remain as long as

                    forth from every crack and corner a small army of these little pests. Being

                <p>for just as soon as one crop disappears another crop appears. Then there is the
                    cockroach. He comes in several sizes, but all of a dark brown color. The
                    smallest roaches are about one-quarter of an inch and the largest are over two
                    inches long. Believe me, the large ones are <soCalled>"some animals."</soCalled>
                    If those big fellows could only be trained for some good purpose or used as
                    runners. Unlike the bedbug, the roach never bites, or in anyway injures human
                    beings, but is always on the lookout for something good to eat. As there are
                    delicacies in nearly every cell, likewise there are roaches in every cell. It
                    matters not if the eatables are wrapped in paper or cardboard, the roach will

                <p>covers as well as the contents. Seen through a microscope, the roach is one of
                    the ugliest things on earth. His body is covered with slime, and the scientists
                    accuse him of carrying tubercular germs from place to place. Like the bedbug, he
                    is a very unwelcome visitor; and an everlasting campaign of extermination must
                    be kept up or they will increase and carry off the prison. Then there is the
                    centipede, also called the thousand-leg or the water bug. He is a dark gray
                    color, is well supplied with legs, is fond of damp places and usually makes his
                    home in cracks in the stone walls. While I have never known of him to bite or
                    injure a human being, yet it is unpleasant to have him take his daily exercise
                    over your body as you lie in bed. And he certainly can run; I believe that he
                    can beat a race horse running.</p>

                <p>The centipedes, however, are not nearly as plentiful as the bedbugs and roaches.
                    Then there is the little ant. Your wife may divorce you, and your best girl go
                    back on you, while you lie in prison at Lancaster, but your ant &#8212; never. I
                    should have said ants for there are many of all sizes and colors. There is the
                    little red one, the large brown one, and still a very large black one. If you
                    have sugar and sweet things in your cell, the ants will camp there forever.
                    These latter, however, disappear during the cold months, while the other three
                    are with you all the time. Like the imps of hades, so are these uninvited guests
                    at Lancaster - one everlasting pest and scource of misery and pain. </p>

                    especially among the life timers, but somehow the change in temperature of the
                    cell building did not agree with the birds and they are all dead and gone. One
                    life-timer raised many of these little sweet singers, and they were all the
                    world to him. Shame on a certain prison official who, when his office expired
                    and before leaving Lincoln, went to the life-timer and took his birds. <said>"I
                        will send you a check soon,"</said> he said to the life-timer. Several years
                    have passed and the check has not come yet, and it never will. I have known some
                    mean men. We once had a fellow serving a year for entering a dwelling house and
                    stealing seven cents out of a baby's little bank as well as drinking the milk
                    out of her bottle. I have always thought that this was the meanest man in the
                    world, but I came to think later that a prison official who earns a good salary
                    and yet will go and take a life-timer's pets away from him, is as mean a man as
                    ever was put into the world, </p>
                <p> Another pet was <q>"Joe."</q> He was a large blacksnake with headquarters in the
                    wall of the engine house. A fireman serving a long time for forgery made Joe his
                    special pet. When our friend whistled, Joe came out from his hole and the two
                    took luncheon together. One evening Joe disappeared. Perhaps he was looking for
                    religion, for he wandered into the chapel; from there into the office of <ref
                        target="#morse"> Chief Turnkey Frank Morse.</ref> This gentleman was making
                    his daily report when Joe came in, and soon he got a stick and dispatched Joe to
                    another world. The fireman, grief stricken over the loss of his pet, did not
                    sleep that night, nor sleep the next</p>

                        <q>"Tessie,"</q> a fox terrier dog that for years was a pet of the boys
                    until a swift kick by a mule sent her straight to the dog heaven. But by far the
                    most popular of all pets was <q>"Bob",</q> a dog belonging to <ref

                    curiosity besides. He is perhaps the largest goldfish in the state and has been
                    in the greenhouse for over twelve years. I learn with regret as this book goes
                    to press that poor old <q>"Bill"</q> and also his wife, have passed away, and
                    the manager of the greenhouse is downhearted over the loss of his two
                    friends.</p>

                <head type="title">MURDER WITHIN HIS HEART </head>

                <p>On the sixth day of December, 1909, we received a yellow negro by the name of
                        <ref target="#prince"> Albert Prince.</ref> He came from Omaha to serve
                    twelve and a half years for the attempted murder of an Omaha detective. <ref
                        target="#prince"> Prince,</ref> a stranger in Omaha, was hanging around a
                    saloon at Fourteenth and Davenport Streets. When the detective went to question
                    him he turned and without any provocation fired four shots into the body of the
                    detective. Although seriously wounded, he afterwards recovered. <ref
                        target="#prince"> Prince</ref> was arrested, tried and sent to Lancaster
                    where he was registered as number 5374. He no doubt came to Omaha from Kansas
                    City where two yellow negros had committed a lot of highway robberies. A
                    policeman met <ref target="#prince"> Prince</ref> and his pal and ordered them
                    to hold up their hands. The pal obeyed orders but <ref target="#prince">
                        Prince</ref> did not; instead he pulled out a gun and aimed at the officer's
                    heart, but the gun refused to work. With the gun still pointed at the officer he
                    backed away into an alley, disappeared in the darkness and was never seen in
                    Kansas City afterward. But from information furnished by his pal, the officers
                    got a very good description of him and circulars were mailed broadcast. The
                    Omaha detective recognized him from one of these circulars and was ready to
                    arrest him when the negro shot him. We afterwards learned that his home was in
                    Cincinnati where his mother lives. He left home when a mere boy, drifted through
                    the western states, made a trip into Mexico and Central America, and visited the
                    Island of <ref target="#haiti"><sic change="Haiti">Hayti</sic>.</ref> Never did
                    he earn a dollar by honest work, always was he committing crimes, always was
                    there murder within his heart. For a while he made a very good prisoner at
                    Lancaster, and soon became the head barber. In this capacity he goes from shop
                    to shop and shaves the men. While he ingratiated him self with the officers, he
                    at the same time became hated by most of the men. He charged a fee per month for
                    giving good shaves, and woe unto the poor fellow who had no money to tip him. He
                    literally tore the whiskers from his face, and also used towels upon their faces
                    which he had previously used upon the face of a negro. The head barber is a
                    privileged character at Lancaster, is not locked up at the same time as the
                    other prisoners, but spends his evenings in the cell house corridors. During the
                    fall of 1911, <ref target="#prince"> Prince</ref> entered into a plot to
                    liberate <ref target="#johnson">Thomas Johnson,</ref> a negro murderer under
                    sentence to be hung. His intention was to kill the night cell keeper or any
                    prison official that crossed his path, to open <ref target="#johnson"
                        >Johnson's</ref> cell, scale the wall and depart. His plans miscarried, a
                    confederate went to <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> and told of the
                    plot, a search was made, and a long double edged knife and a piece of gas pipe
                    were found concealed beneath the barber chair. <ref target="#prince">
                        Prince</ref> was then removed from his position as a trusty and placed in
                    the hole. Even there he was unruly and troublesome. It became necessary to give
                    him the water cure, which means to turn the hose on him. It did not take long
                    for the cold water to quiet him, and for several days he was good. While I am no
                    particular admirer of <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith,</ref> yet I wish to
                    inform my reader that there was no other way at the time to subdue the negro
                    than either to kill him or to apply the water. <ref target="#smith">Mr.
                        Smith</ref> chose the latter. While speaking of the water cure, I wish to
                    say that the water has never been turned upon a prisoner since that day. In his
                    article in <bibl>"Nebraska State Journal"</bibl> of March 19, 1912, Judge Frost
                    says: <quote>"Michigan has a law against showering with water, a practice still
                        common in Nebraska."</quote> From a talk I have had with the judge I am
                    conviced his intentions are good but that he was misinformed. <ref
                        target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> never found it necessary to use it again,
                    and his successors, <ref target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty,</ref>
                    <ref target="#melick">Warden Melick</ref> and <ref target="#fenton">Warden
                        Fenton</ref> have never used it. It is a thing of the past, discarded
                    forever. <ref target="#prince"> Prince</ref> remained several weeks in the hole
                    and was then taken out and dressed in a striped suit and a ball and chain
                    fastened onto him. He was put to work in the broom factory where he was an
                    everlasting source of trouble. He grew more and more sulky as the days went by.
                    One day while carrying a lot of broomstraw through the factory another prisoner
                    happened to stumble against him and the broomstraw fell upon the floor. He
                    became furious and told the man that if he ever did that again he would kill
                    him; and no doubt, had he had a knife right then and there he would have stabbed
                    the other man to death.</p>
                <p>About this time the prison administration changed, <ref target="#smith"> Warden
                        Smith</ref> retired and <ref target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</ref> and
                        <ref target="#davis">Deputy Warden Davis</ref> took office. One of the first
                    official acts of <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> was to send for <ref
                        target="#prince"> Prince.</ref> The negro came to his office. <said>"Don't
                        you think that you have worn this thing long enough, my boy?"</said> said
                    the deputy warden. <said>"Yes,"</said> was the negro's laconic reply.
                        <said>"Well, I will take it off right now, and here is a pass to the
                        clothing department. You go over and pull off these stripes and get a new
                        suit. Get to look like a man, and act like one."</said> This shows the
                    kindness of <ref target="#david">Mr. David.</ref> Nearly every prisoner would
                    have appreciated a favor of that kind immediately; but did <ref target="#prince"
                        > Prince?</ref> No, he became more and more sulky, and there was murder in
                    his heart. He wanted to get even with the world-with someone, be did not know
                    with whom, but he did know that he must kill somebody. His next move was to
                    start a mutiny in the shop. He suggested that some of the other prisoners take
                    sledge hammers and go from place to place in the shop and break up the
                    machinery, <said>"And while you are doing that I will go upon the guard stand
                        and I will not only kill the but will cut his head plumb off."</said> The
                    other boys refused to join him. He had however, one friend, the prison chaplain,
                        <ref target="#johnson"> Mr. Johnson.</ref> The two would visit every Sunday
                    afternoon, and I presume they talked religion. However all this religion seemed
                    to work the wrong way, for instead of repenting, <ref target="#prince">
                        Prince</ref> became more and more bloodthirsty. He must commit a murder. He
                    put in his spare time in the shop making a piece of steel into a double edged
                    knife, and he made it as sharp as a razor. He carved a wooden handle and
                    fastened the blade onto it with broom wire: It was now a regular stiletto and a
                    weapon well fit to use for assassination.</p>
                <p>On the following Sunday <ref target="#smith">Warden Smith</ref> visited Lancaster
                    and attended church. <ref target="#prince"> Prince</ref> afterwards stated that
                    he was sorry that he did not have the knife with him, and <said>"I would have
                        put Tom Smith on the bum."</said> So the next day he brought the stiletto to
                    his cell and concealed it there. He decided that the deputy warden was to be the
                    next victim.</p>

                <p>
                    <ref target="#davis">Edward D. Davis</ref> was born in the northern part of
                    Wales, November 16, 1846, and came with his parents to Johnstown, Pennsylvania
                    at an early age. Here he grew to manhood, receiving a common school education.
                    In 1863 he enlisted in the hundred-day service, and in 1864 re-enlisted in the
                    Eighty-third Pennsylvania volunteer infantry, and served to the close of the
                    war. He was married May 10, 1871 to Miss Elizabeth Rees, also a native of Wales.
                    His father died in 1883, and his mother in 1889, a victim of the Johnstown
                    flood. In 1878 Mr. and Mrs. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> came to Clay
                    County, locating at Glenville, where he followed blacksmithing until elected
                    sheriff in 1887. He held the office of sheriff for four terms and was a popular
                    and efficient officer. He was a man of splendid physical power and courage. He
                    was accustomed to deal with criminals and was fearless in the discharge of his
                    duties. After retiring from the sheriff's office he and Mrs. Davis traveled a
                    great deal. He practically retired from active life except one term as warden of
                    the penitentiary. He retained business interests in Clay Center, being
                    stockholder in the Commercial State Bank of which he was at one time the
                    vice-president. He was a member of the Masons, Odd Fellows and A. O. U. W. At
                    Lancaster, <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> was well liked by officers and
                    inmates. He believed in strict discipline, firm rules and kind treatment. He and
                    I had many mutual friends working in the mines in Colorado where I formerly
                    operated some mines. He used to drop into the office every night, and we would
                    discuss mining and talk about our Johnstown friends. About eight o'clock he
                    would pull out his watch and say, <said>"It is time for me climb the golden
                        stairs."</said> Then he would go upstairs to his apartments.</p>
                <p>
                    <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> was a great lover of nature, of flowers and
                    of all that was beautiful in life. Especially was he fond of a little rose tree
                    that grew on the lawn in front of the east cell building. I remember one fall
                    day when he and I were taking a little walk in front of the prison, how he
                    turned towards the beds of flowers and said to me: <said>"Well the flowers are
                        fast fading away and the little humming birds too are leaving us. I wonder
                        if we will live to see them next year."</said> I said, <said>"Let us hope
                        so, Warden."</said> For quite a while he did not say anything but we walked
                    in silence. Of what he was thinking I have wondered, and did he have a
                    presentiment of coming evil? I am certain that he did, for often he used to talk
                    with me about the underhanded work done the little band of would-be reformers.
                    Since that time, when I look upon the roses at Lancaster, and see the humming
                    birds, my thoughts wander back to that evening and to my departed friend.</p>

                <p><said>Did you notice that the deputy warden does not wear a flower this
                        morning?"</said> said Frank, the head janitor of the prison to me, on the
                    morning of Sunday, the eleventh of February, 1912. <said>"It looks strange for
                        it is the first Sunday morning that I have ever seen him without a flower of
                        some sort. I went to the greenhouse and brought in this tuberose. Will you
                        be so kind as to take it upstairs to him?</said> I took the tuberose, went
                    up to <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis'</ref> apartments, and asked him why he did
                    not wear a flower this morning as usual. He was in fine spirits and replied:
                        <said>"Well, you see these ladies are forgetting me."</said>
                    <said>"Take a look at him and see whether we are forgetting him or not,"</said>
                    said Mrs. Davis. <said>"Look at his new suit and the new tie I got him."</said>
                    The deputy warden was well dressed at all times, and this morning he looked
                    especially nice in a new light gray suit with a dark blue tie. As I put the
                    tuberose in his buttonhole he said, <said>"Please thank Frank for the
                        flower."</said> We chatted for a little while, then came the signal to go to
                    church. <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> went into the chapel and I went
                    back to the office. Little did I think at that moment, that before midnight, our
                    beloved <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> would lie cold in death.</p>
                <p>The church services passed by as usual. The men had just finished singing the
                    hymn <title>"Stand Up For Jesus,"</title> the notes of the song had hardly died
                    away, and the men were still standing awaiting the benediction. <ref

                    services, walked across the aisle to unlock the south door through which the
                    prisoners pass into the yard and from thence into their cells. All of a sudden
                    the negro <ref target="#prince">Prince,</ref> sneaked up behind him and quickly
                    thrust his dagger into the abdomen of the deputy. Taken by surprise, <ref
                        target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> stepped to one side, throwing forward his
                    hand in defense. <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> followed and quickly dealt
                    him four more blows. <ref target="#wagner">Mr. Wagner,</ref> then a guard,
                    grabbed <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> by the arm. The negro turned around
                    and handed the dagger to <ref target="#wagner">Mr, Wagner.</ref> The negro was
                    told to go to the hole, which he did. <ref target="#wagner">Mr. Wagner</ref>
                    sent me word to telephone to Doctor Stradling and to Doctor Wilmeth. The whole
                    incident was in absolute silence. Never once did <ref target="#davis">Mr.
                        Davis</ref> cry out, although he was stabbed thrice in the abdomen, once
                    below the heart, once in the left side of the face, and once on the hand while
                    using it to guard against the blows. The men also kept quiet, not a single voice
                    was raised, nor was there any confusion of any kind. <ref target="#davis">Mr.
                        Davis</ref> walked into his office, and meeting <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Warden Delahunty</ref> said: <said>"I am going to leave you Jim,"</said>
                    for he realized that he was mortally wounded. Leaning upon the strong arm of Mr.
                    Dinsmore, <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> walked to the hospital and sat
                    down in the operating chair. I wish to pause here and tell my reader about Mr.
                    Dinsmore, or the <soCalled>"Convict Physician,"</soCalled> as Judge Frost calls
                    him. He is a tall, fine appearing man, refined and to all appearances, a
                    gentleman. Thirteen years behind the walls of Lancaster have turned his hair and
                    mustache prematurely gray. He is a well preserved man and walks with a military
                    bearing. He may have his faults, and who has not, but within him beats a heart
                    full of sympathy and mercy. He is serving a life sentence. It is true that he is
                    charged with murder, and it is also true that he at times has violated the
                    prison rules, but nevertheless he is entitled to justice. He has been true and
                    sincere and never professed to be converted, for he is no hypocrite. This <q>"is
                        perhaps one reason why he has incurred the wrath of those blatherskites in
                        skirts who pose as soul savers."</q> He also incurred the everlasting hatred
                    of several of the convicts because he would not supply them with
                        <soCalled>"dope."</soCalled> It was one or two of these latter, on vengeance
                    bent, who told Judge Frost the lies that furnished the basis for the following
                    article, taken from <bibl>"The Lincoln State Journal"</bibl> of March 19, 1912: </p>

                        <quote>"I have already said considerable about Convict <ref
                                target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref>. For years except for one or two
                            times when he was removed for some dereliction, he has been the hospital
                            steward. As such he has handled perhaps nine&#8212;tenths of the
                            medicine administered to the convicts. Many a convict has been afraid to
                            take medicine administered to him. When it is recalled that he killed
                            his wife by using a poison compounded by himself, one cannot wonder. I
                            have had instances narrated to me where this man or that man claimed to
                            have had poison administered to him by Dinsmore. I have even been told
                            of instances where a certain convict was actually poisoned to deaths One
                            ex&#8212;convict has told me of how he himself has been nearly poisoned
                            by a green pill given him by this convict as the state's agent. Whether
                            there is any truth in these stories or not<add place="bottom"> AUTHOR'S
                                NOTE:There is not the slightest truth in these stories.</add> it is
                            certain that no man who is <soCalled>'doing it all'</soCalled> should be
                            administering medicine to his fellow convicts. This man Dinsmore was not
                            licensed to practice medicine. I have a letter from the state board to
                            that effect. I am also assured by the same authority that he is not a
                            licensed druggist. Notwithstanding these facts we have had this
                            spectacle of the state of Nebraska allowing this man to practice
                            medicine upon our helpless convicts. If Dinsmore had done this on the
                            outside of the penitentiary walls he would have been subject to criminal
                            prosecution."</quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Since meeting with Judge Frost I have come to the conclusion that he is a
                        sincere and honest man, who is doing all this for the public welfare, but
                        those who have told him the above have willfully and maliciously lied to
                        him. One of these men is well known to me, and I will tell my reader a
                        little about him. He was sent to Lancaster for life, and easily won the good
                        will of <ref target="#delahunty">Deputy Warden Delahunty.</ref> At his own
                        expense <ref target="#delahunty">Mr. Delahunty</ref> traveled to the extreme
                        western part of the state and interceded for him with the judge and the
                        prosecuting attorney. From these gentlemen, <ref target="#delahunty">Mr.
                            Delahunty</ref> got letters to the governor recommending that the
                        sentence be commuted from life to ten years, which means, with good time
                        allowance deducted, only seven years and one month. Were you, my reader,
                        serving a life sentence at Lancaster, and a man had your sentence reduced to
                        ten years, would you not consider him your best friend? Would you not pray
                        for him every night for the rest of your life? I know I would. But did he
                        show his appreciation? No, his soul was saved by the old women soulsavers,
                        and to them he furnished much information which they peddled around and
                        magnified, and which led up to the tragedy at Lancaster. I recall how this
                        man posed as a reformed sinner and was at the head of his Bible class. Also
                        do I remember the Sunday morning after <ref target="#davis">Warden
                            Davis</ref> was assassinated. This man was discharged from the prison
                        and an officer asked him where he was going, His answer was: <said>"All that
                            I know at the present is that I am going down to take luncheon with Mrs.
                            So&#8212;and&#8212;so, (one of the soulsavers). I may stay in Lincoln
                            for some time, and I may leave right away; I don't know, but I do know
                            that tonight I am going out to pick up a <soCalled>'lady
                                friend'</soCalled>."</said> This sincere gentleman afterwards became
                        an evangelist, a <soCalled>"brother,"</soCalled> with headquarters at the
                        mission, the same religious joint of which I have already informed my
                        reader, the one of grass&#8212;widow fame. And that is a nice and easy life,
                        with no hard work whatever, only to dish out a generous supply of hot air.
                        This he does without much effort. It is indeed interesting to see some of
                        these evangelists standing upon the street corner with down&#8212;cast eyes,
                        praying for us poor sinners, and at the same time watching the slit skirts
                        of the ladies passing by out of one little corner of their eye. From such a
                        source comes the prison story above, and the same is published by Judge
                        Frost in good faith. But a man who is serving a life sentence behind the
                        bars, and who has spent thirteen of his best years at Lancaster, has
                        troubles enough of his own without outsiders making up more for him. It is a
                        great injustice to him to publish such rot without thoroughly investigating
                        whether it is true or not. <q>"They say,"</q>
                        <q>"so&#8212;and&#8212;so."</q> You often hear those two words, <q>"they
                            say,"</q> And who are <soCalled>"they"?</soCalled> God only knows. The
                        scandalmongers use these two words, <q>"they say,"</q> from early until
                        late. Little does it matter to them that a man's reputation, a woman's
                        honor, is ruined by their <q>"they say,"</q> Today <q>"they say,"</q> that
                        Jones is intoxicated; tomorrow <q>"they say,"</q> that Jones is a drunkard;
                        and day after tomorrow <q>"they say,"</q> that Jones never drew a sober
                        breath. And thus lies and scandal travel down the line. Soon a person's
                        character and reputation are ruined by <q>"they say,"</q>; but what do they
                        care? I am no particular friend of Mr. Dinsmore, but I like to see him get
                        the square deal. Now that so much bad has been said and written about him by
                        this gang, I am here today to give him justice and set forth some of his
                        many good deeds, one certain one of which will offset all his misdeeds and
                        land him in heaven. Judge Frost has said and written much about this man.
                        When I asked the judge the other day if he had ever called upon <ref
                            target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</ref> for information, he said that
                        he had not, and that he did not even know the warden. I happened to think of
                        what <ref target="#melick">Warden Melick</ref> used to say, <said>"There are
                            always two sides to a story";</said> and before reprimanding an inmate
                        he always heard both the story of the guard and the inmate. Had Judge Frost
                        done likewise and not depended upon the stories of a few discharged inmates
                        bent on revenge, but had gone to the warden and heard his side of the story,
                        the above article would perhaps never have been written. If the judge
                        likewise would have called upon the convict physician and heard his side of
                        the story and thoroughly investigated his work, I am certain that he would
                        have written quite a different article.</p>
                    <p>Soon after <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> was placed in the operating
                        chair, along came the negro brute, <ref target="#prince">Prince,</ref> also
                        headed for the hospital. As he passed the operating room on his way to the
                        hole, he saw the deputy warden lying bleeding in the chair. Shouting
                            <said>"I want to finish him"</said> he sprang towards him, but here is
                        where he reckoned with brave Frank Dinsmore, for while he was attending <ref
                            target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> with one hand, he succeeded in keeping
                        the negro at bay with the other hand until a guard arrived and locked the
                        assassin in a cell. Even after being locked up he kept on shouting <said>"I
                            wish that I had finished him"</said> and <said>"You finish him,
                            Doc."</said> Mr. Dinsmore worked hard and faithfully to save the deputy
                        warden's life, but alas, he kept growing weaker and weaker. Soon Doctor <ref
                            target="#spradling">Spradling</ref> and Doctor <ref target="#wilmeth"
                            >Wilmeth</ref> arrived, but despite the efforts of the doctors he grew
                        worse and worse and an operation was found necessary. This was performed at
                        noon, but he never came out from under the influence of the <sic
                            change="anaesthetics">anesthesia</sic> and passed away at midnight. He
                        has climbed the golden stairs; he has joined the angels above; he is sitting
                        close to the throne.</p>
                    <p><ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> was well liked by the convicts and many
                        were shedding tears in their cells. From time to time they sent inquiries to
                        the office about his condition. The officers and guards did not go to bed
                        but remained in the hall awaiting the outcome. None of us ate anything: we
                        were too grieved to eat. At midnight <ref target="#delahunty">Warden
                            Delahunty</ref> came down stairs. The guards waiting in the hail asked
                        no questions, they could tell by the looks on the <ref target="#delahunty"
                            >warden's</ref> face what had happened. The <ref target="#delahunty"
                            >warden</ref> went into the office and sat down; neither of us spoke a
                        word; both of us cried bitterly for we felt the loss keenly. There was grief
                        and sorrow everywhere-except with one man, the man whose particular duty it
                        was to console the grief-stricken - the chaplain of the prison. His room was
                        on the third floor above those of <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis,</ref> and
                        at midnight he was awakened by the cries of the heartbroken widow on the
                        floor below. He arose, put on his trousers and his vest, but not his coat,
                        and with an impatient look upon his face he wandered up and down the hail.
                        What did it matter to him that a good woman had lost her husband? what did
                        it matter to him that a woman's heart was breaking? &#8212; for was he not
                        losing his sleep?</p>

                    Thirteen years ago <ref target="#dinsmore">Mr. Dinsmore</ref> came to the prison
                    and was put to work in the prison broom shop. Men at the prison are assigned to
                    what position they are best adapted to fill, and it did not take long for the
                    officials to find out that he was too valuable a man to make brooms. If a
                    convict is a bookkeeper on the outside and a bookkeeper is needed, he stands a
                    far better show to get a position as bookkeeper than does one who follows the
                    trade of <emph>stove moulder (sic)</emph>; likewise, is a <emph>stove moulder

                    the ranks of those keeping books for a living. At no time is a prisoner assigned
                    to a certain position in order to satisfy the wishes of a gang of gossipers.</p>

                <p>When a hospital steward was needed, the choice of the administration fell upon
                        <ref target="#dinsmore">Mr. Dinsmore</ref>, he being the best educated man
                    behind the walls. Judge <ref target="#frost">Frost</ref> in his article says
                    that he has a letter from the state board of health stating that <ref
                        target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref> has no license to practice medicine and is
                    not even a registered pharmacist, all of which is true. Likewise it is correct
                    that if he went to <emph>practise (sic)</emph> medicine on the outside that he
                    would be arrested. Although without a license he is far better qualified to
                        <emph>practise (sic)</emph> medicine than many a quack in Lincoln or
                    throughout the country who managed to to squeeze through college, or who in some
                    mysterious way obtained a diploma. The fact of the matter is that for years the
                    great state has not paid the prison doctor a salary befitting a fourth-class
                    horse doctor, nevertheless once in a while the prison has had a most efficient
                    physician. The salary paid was only seventy-five dollars per month; and no
                    doctor, who is a doctor, can afford to give his entire time to the prison for
                    that little amount. He used to come to the prison for two hours every other day
                    only; in other words, he put in six or seven hours each week. Since then the
                    doctor's salary has been increased to one hundred dollars per month, and he now
                    stays at the prison from eight o'clock in the morning until four in the
                    afternoon. Even this arrangement is not as it ought to be. The state should have
                    a first-class physician, should pay him a decent salary and furnish him with
                    apartments at the prison so that he could be there day and night. Never does a
                    week pass by at the prison but what somebody is injured or wounded in the
                    factories. At the time of the shirt factory boys would often willfully injure
                    their fingers that they may be excused for a day or two from that inferno.
                    Considering that there are about four hundred inhabitants to look after, my
                    reader can imagine that the hospital steward, who acts as doctor in the absence
                    of the real doctor, is kept busy; and from his thirteen years experience, Mr.
                        <ref target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref> has become an expert in the bandaging
                    of wounds and in caring for the sick. I will leave it to Judge <ref
                        target="#frost">Frost</ref> and my readers to decide which is the best,
                    either to let a wounded man bleed to death, or perhaps have blood poison set in
                    while awaiting the arrival of a licensed practitioner, or have this <q>"Convict
                        Physician,"</q> as the judge calls him, attend to him, stop the flow of
                    blood immediately and save the finger, the arm, or perhaps the life of the
                    injured person. Especially, when this man, after his thirteen years of
                    experience can do it as well as a young doctor just out of college, and much
                    better than many practicing physicians who in all their practice have not tied
                    up as many wounds as has this man in a few months. I have in my pocket a
                    memorandum book; I notice that a page is given to <title ref="#firstaid">"First
                        Aid to the Injured."</title> I also see in the almanac upon my desk another
                    page entitled <title ref="#helpincase">"Help in Case of accidents."</title> The
                    saving of a human life is quite important, and where a life is at stake I think
                    that all prejudice, all <emph>gossipping (sic)</emph> and red tape should be
                    dispensed with. At no place in the <title ref="#bible">Bible</title> do I find
                    where <ref target="#jesus">Jesus</ref> had a license to practice medicine, yet
                    he healed the masses and instructed his disciples to heal all kinds of sickness
                    and disease. Neither do I read of any record of that <ref
                        target="#goodsamaritan">good Samaritan</ref> being licensed, who came along
                    and saved the life of the man lying in the public road. In making these
                    statements I do not condemn the practice of medicine but refer to emergencies
                    only. And like the <ref target="#goodsamaritan">good Samaritan</ref>, this
                    convict physician has for years healed the wounded and administered to the sick
                    regardless of whether they were rich or poor, black or white. He has done this
                    at all hours and without a penny's remuneration. He worked hard and faithfully
                    to save the lives of those prison officials who fell at their post of duty,
                    victims of assassins, and many lives have been saved and hundreds of dollars
                    have been saved the state. Had the would-be reformers seen the work that this
                    man has done they would perhaps instead of making his life miserable, appeal to
                    the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> for mercy and clemency for him. May
                    the day soon come when some executive will see things in their right light and
                    grant the <q>"Convict Physician"</q> a pardon. </p>

                <p>Following the attack upon the <ref target="#davis">deputy warden</ref>, <ref
                        target="#prince">Prince</ref> was placed in the hole but not strung up; the
                    following day a cot was given him. When it became known that <ref
                        target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> had passed away there was much unrest among
                    the guards, some of whom wanted to lynch the <sic>negro</sic>; however, common
                    sense prevailed and about one o'clock they went to bed. As a precautionary
                    measure <ref target="#delahunty">Warden Delahunty</ref> had previously taken the
                    keys from the turnkey and <sic>secreted</sic> them. I doubt if the
                        <sic>negro</sic> ever knew how near he came to being lynched that night.
                    After being placed in the hole he became quite talkative. To Deputy County
                    Attorney <ref target="#hager">Hager</ref> he confessed that he had planned the
                    murder on that same Sunday morning. When asked by Mr. <ref target="#hager"
                        >Hager</ref> if he had a desire to avenge some wrong committed against him
                    by Mr. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref>, he said that he did not have anything
                    against Mr. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> in particular but that he had it in
                    for <ref target="#smith">Tom Smith</ref> and his deputy, <ref target="#welton"
                        >Jim Welton</ref>, and would like to have <q>"gotten"</q> them. He said that
                        <ref target="#davis">Mr. Davis</ref> reprimanded him once for taking a fork
                    to his cell but that he was not sore against him for that. It was the prison,
                    the prison rules and prison managers that he was against and not any individual.
                    Like the anarchists who kill kings, it was the same way with <ref
                        target="#prince">Prince</ref>. They seem not to realize that just as soon as
                    their victim is dead there is another person to take his place. He expressed no
                    signs of regret; on the contrary he said that <sic>be</sic> was sorry that he
                    did not complete the murder.</p>

                <p>I recall how the little army of soulsavers left the chapel on the noon after Mr.
                        <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> was assassinated. Not one of them stopped
                    at the office to inquire as to the condition of the deputy. Standing in the
                    office the warden. and I saw them pass out and go across the road. They were in
                    high spirits and laughing as if they had just left a vaudeville show. <said>"A
                        sympathetic lot of Christians,"</said> I said to <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Mr. Delahunty</ref>. The warden did not answer, his eyes were full of
                    tears. I thought of what would have happened had circumstances been reversed and
                    Mr. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> had seen the <sic>negro</sic> in time and
                    felled him to the floor. There would not have been any laughter then, but the
                    news would soon have been scattered broadcast of the shameful treatment of a
                    poor inmate in the house of the Lord, and the innocent public would have
                    believed it. Did any of these soulsavers call and comfort the widow in her great
                    sorrow? No, indeed, but several of them phoned out afterward and asked
                        <said>"How is dear <ref target="#prince">Mr. Prince</ref> getting
                        along?"</said></p>

                <p>For several days he was gloomy and had but little to say. He spent most of his
                    time fixing up his cell and making himself as comfortable as possible. A wire
                    was ex-tended up into his cell and furnished him with light. A shoe box served
                    as writing desk and parlor table combined. Crowds of curiosity seekers flocked
                    to the prison that afternoon and for several days thereafter. They wanted to see
                    the murderer; and strange to say there came ten women to one man. They were
                    politely told <said>"nothing doing,"</said> and were much disappointed for they
                    would have liked <said>"so much to see the poor boy."</said> To Reverend Doctor
                        <ref target="#may">May</ref>, his spiritual adviser, and to Messrs <ref
                        target="#howard1">Howard</ref> and <ref target="#howard2">Howard</ref>, his
                    attorneys, the doors were open at any time.</p>

                <p>He was given a preliminary examination, where he pleaded not guilty. His trial
                    was set for June the sixth. On his second day in the hole he wrote a letter to
                    his <ref target="#msprince">mother</ref> in Ohio and told her not to worry, that
                    he would be all right. He also wrote a letter to his <ref target="princebrother"
                        >stepbrother</ref> in <ref target="#newyork">New York</ref> and asked him to
                    come to <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. He wrote to several religious
                    people, and received several cards and religious papers from unknown sources.
                    Also a card came with a skull and crossbones. It read <quote>"Give <ref
                            target="#satan">Satan</ref> my best regards, and I will send you down a
                        chunk of ice."</quote> This card we never delivered to him as it is the
                    policy at the prison not to deliver any mail to any inmate that has a tendency
                    to hurt his feelings or to cause him to worry. A box of candy also came. There
                    was no name of the sender upon the box. As it had a peculiar odor we thought
                    that it perhaps contained poison, so it was consigned to the bottom of the lake.
                    Well did we know that if the candy was poisoned and the <sic>negro</sic> died
                    from eating it, that our friends, the soulsavers, would raise the cry
                        <soCalled>"They have poisoned the poor boy."</soCalled>
                    <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> had about twelve dollars to his credit in the
                    prison bank at the time of the murder. He now invested in horse hair, from which
                    he made watch fobs that were sold at the prison cigar stand. In this way he made
                    several dollars. When he was not making watch fobs he was writing poetry which
                    he sent to his correspondents. Off and on he also sent small sums of money to a
                    former prison official who had <soCalled>"resigned"</soCalled> and who lived in
                        <ref target="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</ref>. Soon his <ref
                        target="#princebrother">stepbrother</ref> arrived and found work in a hotel.
                    He looked more like a twin brother to the murderer than a stepbrother. They were
                    permitted to visit each other, but a guard stood by and heard their
                    conversation. The brother usually brought a bag of fruit. This was always given
                    a most careful examination. After <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> had been in
                    the hole for a few days he sent for and was given a <title ref="#bible"
                        >Bible</title> and became a most ardent <title ref="#bible">Bible</title>
                    student. What a pity that he did not commence long ago!</p>

                <p>At his trial, held in June, his attorneys fought hard to save his life from the
                    gallows but the odds were against them. He was found guilty and Judge <ref
                        target="#cornish">Cornish</ref> sentenced him to hang on August the
                    thirteenth. Mr. <ref target="#howard1">Howard</ref> immediately appealed to the
                        <sic>su-preme</sic> court. It was during his trial that <ref
                        target="#prince">Prince</ref>, upon seeing Mrs. <ref target="#msdavis"
                        >Davis</ref> enter the court room, turned to Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref> and said: <said>"If I had stopped to think of the grief and
                        sorrow that my crime would cause that woman, I would never have done it. As
                        I look upon her and see how she suffers I feel sorry for what I did."</said>
                    This was the only time that he ever expressed any regret over his crime. When
                    going to and from the courthouse he had walked erect, with an air of bravado,
                    and seemed to enjoy the notoriety that he was getting. He had expected a life
                    sentence, and now he was much disappointed, became sullen and gloomy, and seemed
                    to realize that he was up against it. He studied the <title ref="#bible"
                        >Bible</title> more and more, and wrote many letters to religious people,
                    also to the former <ref target="#tecumeshprisonchaplain">prison chaplain</ref>
                    at <ref target="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</ref> who had come to his trial at his
                    request as a witness, but whose testimony did him neither good nor harm. Warden
                        <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> treated him as he treated all the other
                    prisoners, with kindness. He had a guard take him out for a walk every other day
                    and he enjoyed the privilege. Nevertheless he would often become unruly. One
                    morning he asked the doctor for some <said>"dope."</said> He was promptly
                    refused and he appealed to the warden. Colonel <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref> came to see him but also refused. Then <ref target="#prince"
                        >Prince</ref> asked the reason why. The <ref target="#melick">Warden</ref>
                    gave as his reason, that the <sic>negro</sic> would not be able to make peace
                    with his maker with his brains clouded with poison. From time to time he asked
                    for <said>"dope"</said> and each time he was refused. He was hoping that the
                    supreme court would either grant him a new trial or change the sentence from
                    death to life imprisonment; but that high tribunal concurred with the trial
                    court and fixed the twentieth day of April, 1913 for the execution. <ref
                        target="#prince">He</ref> now turned to the pardon board to save his life
                    from the gallows. A hearing was granted, and those interested appeared before,
                    the board in the prison library. Mr. <ref target="#hager">Hager</ref>, deputy
                    county attorney, appeared for the state. His speech was short and to the point.
                    He stated that the murderer had had a fair and impartial trial and that the
                    supreme court had concurred with the trial court. Mr. <ref target="#howard1"
                        >Howard</ref>, his attorney, pleaded that the sentence of his client be
                    commuted to life imprisonment and so did also several good Christians, who do
                    not believe in capital punishment. The fake religionists also appeared in his
                    behalf that they might get a little notoriety. Within a few days the board
                    reported to the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref>. Doctor <ref
                        target="#butler">Butler</ref>'s report was a most interesting document. It
                    set forth how the doctor, anticipating this hearing, had set out to investigate
                    the past life of the murderer, and had traced his wanderings from time to time.
                    It showed how <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> had been a criminal since
                    boyhood, and how he kept up his crime behind the prison walls. To commute his
                    sentence to life imprisonment was to place in jeopardy the lives of the prison
                    officials and guards at the prison. Mr. <ref target="#maggi">Maggi</ref>
                    concurred with Doctor <ref target="#butler">Butler</ref>, while Mr. <ref
                        target="#yeiser">Yeiser</ref> being opposed to capital punishment favored
                    life sentence. The governor did not overrule the findings of the two courts and
                    the pardon board, and refused to interfere.</p>

                <p>Much has been said for and against capital punishment, and several bills were
                    drafted to abolish it in the last legislature. From time immemorial, criminals
                    have been executed, and for various offenses. This fact, however, is in my
                    opinion no argument in its favor. For instance, in the year of 1279 two hundred
                    and eighty Jews were hanged in England for clipping coin; and a few years later
                    the <ref target="#mayorexeter">mayor of <ref target="#exeter"
                    >Exeter</ref></ref>, England, and the town marshal were hanged for leaving the
                    town gates unfastened one night. During the reign of <ref target="#henryVIII"
                        >Henry the VIII</ref> thirty-seven thousand criminals, both men and women,
                    were executed for various offenses. Among these, one woman was put to death on
                    the gallows for stealing a shillings worth of lace. But as the world progresses
                    the laws change, and today only murderers forfeit their lives upon the gallows,
                    and even these are given every chance possible to prove their innocence. Take
                    for instance, this murderer <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref>. It was a clear
                    case of premeditated, willful and uncalled for murder, yet it took fourteen
                    months to take his case through two courts before the pardon board and the <ref
                        target="#aldrich">governor</ref>, before he paid the penalty for his
                    crime.</p>

                <p>In my opinion capital punishment should not be abolished in <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>, for neither in this nor any other western
                    state does a life sentence mean life. A life termer goes, and is a good
                    prisoner, and in from ten to thirteen years and often much less, some
                    kind-hearted governor commutes his sentence. Even if a life sentence meant a
                    life sentence a prisoner serving life would have nothing to lose by committing a
                    murder in the prison, for the courts could not add any more years to his
                    sentence. With capital punishment abolished, what could they do to him? That is
                    why several states that have abolished capital punishment regret it, and why
                    some return to it. Should it be abolished in <ref target="#nebraska"
                        >Nebraska</ref>, I would suggest that the <ref target="#california"
                        >California</ref> law be passed here. Out there they have a clause in the
                    law abolishing capital punishment - that any prisoner who is serving a sentence
                    in the pen and who kills a prison officer, attache or guard, shall forfeit his
                    life. To this clause I would suggest adding: <soCalled>"or another
                        convict,"</soCalled> for the inmates are just as much subject to the wrath
                    of these murderers, as are the officials. </p>

                <head type="title">THE HANGING </head>

                <p>Sitting in his little cell, <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> saw his doomsday
                    last approaching. He still hoped that at the last minute either the legislature
                    or the governor would change his sentence to life imprisonment. One of the
                    soulsavers dropped into my office one day to ask my opinion of what she called a
                    splendid plan that ought to give satisfaction to all concerned, and which she
                    intended to take up with the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref>. Her plan was
                    to ask the governor to commute the sentence to life imprisonment that he might
                    turn over his earnings in the prison to the widow of his victim. I told her that
                    she was only wasting her time, for well did I know that the <ref
                        target="#msdavis">widow</ref> would not touch anything that came from the
                    murderer; and furthermore, all the money in the state would not make up her
                    loss, for to her it was not a matter of dollars and cents. The suggestion was
                    indeed a most ridiculous one, Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> went out
                    of office during the month of January, and was pleased that he did not have to
                    superintend the execution. This became the duty of the new warden, Mr. <ref
                        target="#fenton">Fenton</ref>. This is usually the duty of the deputy
                    warden, but before accepting the office as deputy warden, Mr. <ref
                        target="#harmon">Harmon</ref> made an agreement with Mr. <ref
                        target="#Fenton">Fenton</ref> not to take any part in the hanging. From all
                    corners of the state came requests for permission to attend the execution, all
                    of which were denied. The warden intended to obey the law that prescribes that
                    only those needed as attendants - the coroner, six physicians, and the
                    prisoner's spiritual adviser, are to be admitted. Printed cards were issued to
                    these gentlemen and also to <sic>The</sic> representative for the <title
                        ref="#lincolnstar">"Lincoln Star"</title> and two other press
                    correspondents. It was a strange coincidence that the murderer as well as the
                    rope with which he was hung, both came from <ref target="#cincinati"
                        >Cincinnati</ref>. The rope cost ten dollars, has a knot tied, has been
                    tested and is ready for business. The twentieth day of April came along. It was
                    a beautiful spring day. From early morning and up to noon there came a stream of
                    curiosity seekers who begged to be admitted. They were all refused, yet they
                    lingered around the corridors until the execution was over with.</p>

                <p>The hanghouse is located in the southwest corner of the prison. Judging from
                    outside appearances it could be easily taken for a woodshed. When not in use it
                    serves to store the box lumber belonging to the broom-factory. All of this had
                    been taken out. Mr. <ref target="#stryker">Stryker</ref>, the state executioner,
                    had put the gallows in order, tested the rope, installed the electric batteries,
                    and everything was ready for business. I must explain that the trap door upon
                    which the murderer stands is sprung by electricity; then his body shoots into
                    the pit underneath. There are six buttons to press. Six men press these buttons
                    upon a sign from the executioner. None of the six knows which
                        <sic>par-ticular</sic> button springs the door. The hanging was set for two
                    o'clock. The attendants began to arrive and were furnished with admission cards.
                    With Doctor <ref target="#sward">Sward</ref> came his <ref
                        target="#assistantsurgeon">assistant surgeon</ref>, who was to make an
                    analysis of the murderer's blood. They all marched to the hanghouse and took
                    their seats. Shortly afterward came the condemned man, walking steadily and
                    erect between Warden <ref target="#fenton">Fenton</ref> and Reverend <ref
                        target="#may">May</ref>. Not a word was spoken, everything was quiet. The
                        <ref target="#prince">prisoner</ref> had no statement to make and mounted
                    the scaffold. He was dressed in a neat black suit, black tie, black hose and
                    slippers bought that same day for the occasion. He walked upon the scaffold, the
                    black cap was quickly adjusted, the six buttons were touched, his body swung
                    into the pit and his soul passed into eternity, there to meet its fate. This was
                    only a matter of three minutes. In thirteen minutes he was pronounced dead, the
                    body turned over to the undertaking <sic>es-tablishment</sic> of <title
                        ref="castleropermatthews">Castle, Roper &amp; Matthews</title>, and by them
                    shipped to <ref target="#ohio">Ohio</ref> for burial.</p>

                <p>I have been in the banking business for many years but never once was I called on
                    to cash a check executed by a dead man; but on that evening Chaplain <ref
                        target="#johnson">Johnson</ref> presented to me for payment, a check drawn
                    by <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> on the prison bank and payable to him for
                    the balance of <ref target="prince">Prince</ref>'s account. As it was small,
                    less than ten dollars, I honored the check. The next day came another preacher,
                    the one who accused us of peddling the choicest steaks, and put in a claim for
                        <said>"something left him by <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref>."</said> I
                    told him there was nothing for him, and he departed much disappointed, reminding
                    me of a vulture that, hovering over what was once a dead body, finds only the
                    bones. The Rev. Doctor <ref target="#may">May</ref>, who had been the murderer's
                    spiritual adviser, who at his own expense had made the trips to the prison to be
                    of real service to the <sic>condemned. man,</sic> presented no check, nor did he
                    make any claims. That sincere and good man will reap his harvest close to the
                    throne.</p>

                <p>It was a great relief indeed to have this matter off our hands. Had the sentence
                    been commuted this man would have been an everlasting source of trouble, as
                    sooner or later he would have killed one or more men. Eleven men have paid the
                    penalty upon these same gallows. <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref>'s hanging is
                    the last in the state, for the gallows have been torn down to be replaced with
                    the electric chair. Let us hope that nobody will ever sit in it.</p>

                <head type="title">A "RESIGNATION" </head>

                <p>Following the assassination of Mr. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> a deputation
                    of twenty-nine ministers of Lincoln called on Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref> and asked to inspect the prison. We never knew who had
                    arranged this meeting, but we were satisfied that they were earnest and
                    well-meaning men who were out there for the public welfare and to see if the
                    place was really as black as it had been painted. The warden met them at the
                    door and gave them a cordial reception. Chaplain <ref target="#johnson"
                        >Johnson</ref> did not know of their coming and appeared much surprised over
                    it. The ministers were given a chance to see the entire prison and to inspect
                    the food. They afterwards made several suggestions as to certain improvements in
                    the prison but found nothing against the administration. They came like
                    gentlemen and departed in peace.</p>

                <p>But the little army of old women soul savers were busier than ever and more
                    underhanded work went on than ever before. A blow from the assassin's dagger had
                    removed one of the obstacles from their path, but another one still remained,
                    and he too ought to go that they again could hold high carnival at the
                    prison.</p>

                <p>I recall how Chaplain <ref target="#johnson">Johnson</ref> came to me one evening
                    and made inquiry about the amount of money to the credit of the prisoners. I
                    told him, that like in any other bank we did not reveal the balances of our
                    depositors. <said>"Well,"</said> he said, <said>"it matters not so much to me
                        what the individual has on deposit, what I want to know is general
                        statistics. The story goes down on the streets of Lincoln that some men have
                        so much on deposit while others have much more. We will classify these men
                        and call those men who have one thousand dollars or over, Class A. And those
                        with between five hundred and one thousand dollars Class B, etc. What I want
                        to know is how many are in Class B and so on."</said> I refused to get him
                    this information and suggested that he get it from the warden. He walked away.
                    When the warden came into the office I told him about having refused the
                    chaplain this information, and he said, <said>"You were right. He is here to
                        preach and not to meddle with the accounts."</said> A few days later the
                    chaplain called on Governor <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref> and complained
                    against the warden. The visit terminated in the chaplain
                        <soCalled>"resigning"</soCalled> his position at the invitation of the <ref
                        target="#aldrich">governor</ref> to do so. The warden was notified, and soon
                    the chaplain came to the prison, went to his room, gathered up his belongings
                    and departed. No tears were shed over his departure - all felt relieved. We
                    looked forward to days of peace and happiness. </p>

                <p>Never shall I forget the fourteenth day of March, 1912. A blizzard was raging, it
                    was an awful day, a day just fitted for the commission of a crime. Warden <ref
                        target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> came into the office about seven
                    o'clock. It was his fifty-fifth birthday. As he passed by my desk I
                    congratulated him and wished him many happy years. He thanked me and went on to
                    his desk where he worked until eleven o'clock. He got up several times to look
                    out. The cars were not running regularly. He told me that he wanted to go and
                    see Mr. <ref target="#huckins">Huckins</ref>, publisher of the <title
                        ref="#lincolnherald">"Lincoln Herald,"</title> but thought he would postpone
                    the trip on account of the weather. He tried to get Mr. <ref target="#huckins"
                        >Huckins</ref> by phone, but the phone refused to work. At noon he went
                    upstairs and sat down and talked with his mother for a while.</p>

                <p>After dinner the deputy warden, Mr. <ref target="#wagner">Wagner</ref>, sent a
                    note to me asking me to come to his office. This was between one and two
                    o'clock. I went in there, and Mr. <ref target="#wagner">Wagner</ref> explained
                    that he wanted me to write to <ref target="#kansascity">Kansas City</ref> to get
                    the record of an inmate. I left right away, and no sooner had I sat down at my
                    desk than I heard six shots fired in the chapel in rapid succession. I rushed to
                    the door and looked into the turnkey room, where I saw <ref target="#pahl">Claus
                        Pahl</ref>, the turnkey crouching on the floor. I asked him what was the
                    matter. He turned and looked at me but did not answer. I noticed that he was
                    very pale and his eyes protruded from his head. To me he looked like an insane
                    person, and I thought that it was he who had gone mad and had fired the shots.
                    Afterwards I realized that he was <soCalled>"scared to death."</soCalled> If he
                    had thrown his keys into the hall when I spoke to him or departed by the side
                    door, he would have saved the day; but doing as he did, he simply lost it. For a
                    minute I retired to the office. Soon the usher, Mr. <ref target="#heilman"
                        >Heilman</ref>, came staggering in and fell upon the floor seriously
                    wounded. The good old man had heard the noise and rushed out of his office into
                    the <sic>hail</sic> to see what was going on. He was struck by a bullet fired by
                        <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> who stood guard while <ref target="#gray"
                            ><q>"Shorty Gray"</q></ref> was working on the door leading from the
                    library into the turnkey. Poor Mr. <ref target="#heilman">Heilman</ref> fell
                    upon the floor. Then the chief clerk, Mr. <ref target="#ward">Ward</ref>, and I
                    picked him up and placed him gently in a chair. Just at that time I heard a
                    terrific explosion, that of blowing the lock from the door. At the same time
                    Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> came running down stairs,
                    grabbed his gun, and standing in the doorway kept shooting at the desperadoes,
                    who returned the fire. At the same time, Chief Clerk <ref target="#ward"
                        >Ward</ref> made a bee-line for the vault, pulled the inside doors partly
                    shut and remained there during the fight. At the same time <ref target="#robb"
                        >Steward Robb</ref> ran into his office and shut the door, but I want to
                    give Mr. <ref target="#robb">Robb</ref> credit for not posing as a hero and for
                    telling the truth. He told the public that he was unarmed and hence retreated to
                    his office and shut the door. Thus Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref> and I were the only two left on the floor. As the warden
                    advanced I followed him, 'confident that he would conquer the enemy. Never
                    before did I see Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> move about so
                    quickly as he did there when fighting for his state and his honor. There was a
                    strange look upon his face - to me he looked many years younger. Altogether he
                    fired five shots, the desperadoes firing back at him, one bullet landing in the
                    door casing above his head. In firing the fourth shot he leaned too much forward
                    and a bullet struck him in the side. He turned around and for a minute stooped
                    over as if he was going to fall but suddenly jumped forward and fired another
                    shot. By this time he was getting weak and fell to the floor. I kneeled down
                    beside him and comforted him.</p>

                <p>For a few minutes he sat in an upright position but grew weaker and weaker, and
                    with the words, <said>"Oh, my Lord,"</said> he fell backwards on the floor. At
                    the same time the desperadoes made the turnkey hold up his hands and deliver
                    over the keys. Then the turnkey went into hiding in the cellar. They opened the
                    door leading out into the hail and ran out into the open, firing into the office
                    as they ran. One bullet which was perhaps intended for me ploughed through a
                    large calendar hanging on the wall, cut it in two pieces, and landed in the
                    window casing. I wish to make mention right here of a heroine, who was never
                    mentioned in the newspapers, but who deserves great credit for what she did. I
                    do not even know her name. I refer to the <ref target="#heroine">Bell telephone
                        operator</ref> on duty that afternoon. As the desperadoes disappeared I left
                    the warden for a minute, told the <ref target="#heroine">Bell operator</ref>
                    what had happened and asked her to notify the <ref target="#aldrich"
                        >governor</ref>, the sheriff the chief of police, Mr. <ref target="#hughes"
                        >Hughes</ref>, manager of <ref target="nebraskabankers">Nebraska Bankers
                        Association</ref>, and to send out a general alarm. This she did, and did it
                    well. I then returned to the warden. He was not bleeding at all, but was getting
                    weaker and weaker. Just then his brother, <ref target="#delahunty">John
                        Delahunty</ref>, night yardmaster at the prison, came downstairs. He had
                    heard the noise and came to investigate. He had dressed hurriedly and had on no
                    shoes or hose. He came down just as the desperadoes slammed the door. Had he
                    come one minute sooner perhaps he too would have forfeited his life. Just then
                    the warden's revolver fell from his hand. I handed it to <ref
                        target="#delahunty">John</ref>. I also told him what had happened that the
                    turnkey doors were wide open and that there was nothing to prevent all the
                    prisoners from walking out. He went in search of <ref target="#pahl">Turnkey
                        Pahl</ref>, but that gentleman was nowhere to be found. He then went to lock
                    the door that leads from the chapel into the yard and thus prevented anyone from
                    going out. At that time, shaking and quivering, the chief clerk, Mr. <ref
                        target="#ward">Ward</ref> emerged from the vault. Also Mr. <ref
                        target="#evans">Henry Evans</ref> was the first to appear upon the scene.
                    Mr. <ref target="#evans">Evans</ref> was at that time a night guard. He is an
                    ex-soldier, one of the bravest men at <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>
                    and a crack shot. He was asleep when the shooting took place in the chapel, and
                    being awakened by the noise dressed hurriedly and went to look into the chapel.
                    He saw at a glance what was going on, but having no arms he went to the chapel
                    tower guard, and asked for the use of his gun for a short time. The tower guard
                    refused. <ref target="#evans">Evans</ref> is a sharpshooter, and if he had
                    appeared on the scene in time I doubt if the desperadoes would have gotten away.
                    Mr. <ref target="#evans">Evans</ref> went back into the prison and got together
                    a bunch of men to carry the warden to his room. Among them was <ref
                        target="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</ref> (called the <q>"Convict
                        Physician"</q> by the soulsavers) and also <ref target="#thomas">Jim
                        Thomas</ref>, the <sic>colored</sic> clerk at the prison cigar stand. As
                    they walked into the office the then chief clerk was calling up the governor's
                    office. He was much excited and was telling that there was a general mutiny.
                        <ref target="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</ref> went over to him and told him
                    that the boys were as quiet as mice. This is how the story started that there
                    was a mutiny and a general outbreak at the prison.</p>
                <p>In the meantime we carried the wounded warden upstairs and laid him on his bed.
                    At his left side were the assistant surgeon, Doctor <ref target="#welch"
                        >Welch</ref>, and Mr. <ref target="#dinsmore">Dinsmore</ref> administering
                    to him. I was at his right side, holding his hand in mine. I asked Doctor <ref
                        target="#welch">Welch</ref> if there was any hope, and he thought there was.
                    He injected some fluid into his left arm. As he did that the warden opened his
                    eyes for a minute, looked at me, squeezed my hand a last farewell and passed
                    into the other world. I could hardly realize that he was dead. It was as if some
                    strange power held me there; and for about half an hour I sat there with his
                    hand in mine and could not leave him. Then Mr. <ref target="#robb">Robb</ref>,
                    the steward, came along. I asked him to lock the doors, as the warden wore some
                    valuable diamonds. We locked the doors and went down stairs. The telephone had
                    done its work and people were arriving at the pen. First came a reporter from
                    the <title ref="lincolndailystar">"Lincoln Daily Star,"</title> the prison
                    physician, Doctor <ref target="#spradling">Spradling</ref>, Dr. <ref
                        target="#finney">E. B. Finney</ref>, Colonel <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref>, <ref target="#matthews">"Jack" Matthews</ref>, coroner of the
                    county, Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> with three of his deputies,
                    Chief of Detectives <ref target="#schmidt">John Schmidt</ref>, Chief of Police
                        <ref target="#hunger">Hunger</ref> with eight officers, and former Deputy
                    Sheriff <ref target="#dawson">Jim Dawson</ref>. Soon Adjutant General <ref
                        target="#phelps">Phelps</ref> with an orderly arrived. He ordered fifty men
                    from Company <q>"F"</q> to report at the prison immediately. The street cars
                    were not running on account of the snow so the men were sent out on a special
                    train over the <ref target="burlington">Burlington</ref> route. They were in
                    charge of Major <ref target="#antles">H. H. Antles</ref>, and Captain <ref
                        target="#hall">Phil Hall</ref>. Major <ref target="#birkner">John M.
                        Birkner</ref> and Doctor <ref target="#sward">Sward</ref> also came out with
                    a squad of the hospital corps, and the prison was now under martial law with
                    Adjutant General <ref target="#phelps">Phelps</ref> in charge. The chapel became
                    the headquarters for the militia and they patrolled all the buildings. When I
                    left Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>'s room and returned to the
                    office, I learned what had taken place on the inside of the prison, and also
                    that the perpetrators of the bloody work were <ref target="#gray">Charles
                        Taylor</ref>, alias Shorty Gray, No. 5762, <ref target="#dowd">John
                        Dowd</ref>, No. 5873, and <ref target="#morley">Charles Morley</ref>, No.
                    5569. These men had sneaked out of the broom shop and gone to the chapel. They
                    entered through the south door, which was never locked at that time, and while
                    one of them covered <ref target="#thomas">Jim Thomas</ref> the cigar clerk, with
                    a gun, the other two went to the deputy warden's office. They did not give Mr.
                        <ref target="#wagner">Wagner</ref> a chance to defend himself, but fired
                    several shots into his breast, from which he died almost instantly. Hearing the
                    noise, Mr. <ref target="#doody">Thomas Doody</ref>, keeper of the west cell
                    house, armed himself and ran into the chapel. The desperadoes jumped behind
                    pillars and kept firing at him. Mr. <ref target="#doody">Doody</ref> returned
                    the fire, but soon he fell, seriously wounded. He managed to crawl out of the
                    building, was assisted back into the cell house, and Mr. <ref target="#dinsmore"
                        >Dinsmore</ref> was sent for to administer to him. Had not the <q>"Convict
                        Physician,"</q> the doctor without a license, as Judge <ref target="#frost"
                        >Frost</ref> calls him, arrived, there is no doubt but what <ref
                        target="#doody">Doody</ref> would have lost his life. Shortly after the
                    shooting of <ref target="#doody">Doody</ref>, came the explosion and the escape
                    of the murderers. The guards on the wails and in the shops heard the explosion.
                    They did not know what was going on but all watched carefully. Every man seized
                    arms of some kind and prison discipline prevailed. In the shops not a man was
                    permitted to leave his machine. Mr. <ref target="#Cockeley">Cokeley</ref>, for
                    many years yardmaster at the prison and in charge of the yard on the day of the
                    outbreak, now gave orders to the convicts to cease work and march to their
                    cells. His conduct during the excitement showed bravery and devotion to duty. He
                    was assisted by Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref>.</p>

                <p>One by one the shops were emptied and all the men locked in their cells. The boys
                    behaved nicely except one, a horse thief from <ref target="benkelman"
                        >Benkelman</ref>, who was noisy. He was taken to the hole by Chief of Police
                        <ref target="#hunger">Hunger</ref>. Mr. <ref target="#doody">Doody</ref> was
                    taken to his room and attended to. Mr. <ref target="#slattery">T. E.
                        Slattery</ref>, for many years a prison official in this and <ref
                        target="#colorado">Colorado</ref> and <ref target="#wyoming">Wyoming</ref>
                    prisons, and a brave man, took charge of the west cell house. The men were all
                    curious to learn what had taken place. When told that the warden was killed they
                    were grief-stricken. Many wept bitterly for the warden was beloved by all the
                    boys. <said>"Poor <ref target="#delahunty">Jim</ref>,"</said> some of them said,
                        <said>"he was strictly on the square."</said> I heard many of them express
                    hopes that the murderers would be captured and hung. So intense was the feeling
                    against the desperadoes by the other prisoners that many of them would be
                    willing to start out and hunt them, put them to death and then return to their
                    prison home.</p>

                <p>Governor <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref> was not in the city when I called
                    the office but his private secretary, Mr. <ref target="#fuller">Fuller</ref>,
                    got busy and located the governor at <ref target="#auburn">Auburn</ref> where he
                    was snowbound, and told him of the trouble. It was fortunate that the governor
                    was in <ref target="#auburn">Auburn</ref> and not in <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref>, for down there he made arrangements with the <ref
                        target="#belltelephonecompany">Bell Telephone Company</ref> for the
                    uninterrupted use of the line to <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. He
                    immediately got Adjutant General <ref target="#phelps">Phelps</ref> on the line
                    and gave the general instructions as to what to do. The <ref target="#aldrich"
                        >governor</ref> was grief-stricken over the murder and made preparations to
                    get a special train to take him to <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. In the
                    meantime he instructed General <ref target="#phelps">Phelps</ref> to take charge
                    and appointed Steward <ref target="#robb">Mont Robb</ref> as Warden pro tem. He
                    also instructed Mr. <ref target="#maggi">Maggi</ref>, chairman of the pardon
                    board, to proceed to the prison and look after the boys. Mr. <ref
                        target="#maggi">Maggi</ref> learned that there was to be no supper served
                    that evening, but he proceeded to the kitchen and had supper prepared and served
                    in the cells. Posses now left the prison and went in every direction; pictures
                    were made of the murderers and sent broadcast; telegrams were sent to every
                    officer in the state; and all the sheriffs in the eastern part of <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> immediately organized posses and took up
                    the trail. At the prison telephone inquiries kept coming in till after midnight.
                    At two o'clock I went to bed, but was too downhearted to sleep and several times
                    I had to get up and walk the floor. </p>

                <p><ref target="#delahunty">James Delahunty</ref> was born in <ref target="#peoria"
                        >Peoria</ref>, <ref target="#illinois">Illinois</ref>, March 14, 1857, and
                    the tragic feature of the killing was the fact that the day was the fifty-fifth
                    anniversary of his birth; and on the same hour of the day as occurred his birth
                    also occurred his death. He came to <ref target="#clay">Clay</ref> county, <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>, about twenty-eight years ago with his
                    parents, settling on a farm now occupied by his family two miles northeast of
                        <ref target="#clay">Clay</ref> Center. <ref target="#delahunty">Jim</ref>,
                    as he was universally known, was an honorable, upright, good and true man and
                    was respected and beloved by all with whom he came in contact. He was well
                    educated, and was fitted for any position in life. For two years he served as
                    deputy county clerk of <ref target="#clay">Clay</ref> county, and about ten
                    years at the prison in various positions. He served under five governors and
                    rose from steward to deputy warden and afterwards to warden.</p>
                <p>His memory was superior to any I have ever seen. He could remember the names and
                    even the numbers of inmates at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"
                        >Lancaster</ref>. He would call them by name when they came back after
                    having been out for years. He considered a prisoner a man, a fellow being with a
                    heart and a soul, and treated them with kindness. He believed that the prison
                    was a place of safekeeping and not a place of punishment. He was a Catholic but
                    believed that this is a free country and that each person has a right to worship
                    his God as his heart desires. When it came to business among employees and
                    inmates, Catholics and Protestants all looked alike to him. He was a quiet,
                    dignified man who said but little, but what he did say you could depend upon.
                    His word was as good as a government bond. The inmates used to say, <said>"If
                        Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Jim</ref> says so, you can depend upon it
                        absolutely."</said> He was charity from the bottom of his heart, especially
                    to the outgoing inmates. This is</p>

                    came to know it during the last four months of his life, when I enjoyed his
                    confidence. He has helped many a man out of prison, and made several long trips
                    at his own expense to plead with court officials in the prisoner's behalf. I
                    have known of relatives of the prisoners, who came to Lincoln and their money
                    gave out. Quietly and without any advertising he helped them along, and at times
                    sent them to their home. I have known of two cases where a prisoner after
                    serving a long sentence was to be rearrested and taken to another state to stand
                    trial on another charge. Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> being
                    satisfied that they had been punished more than sufficient, and that they were
                    going to lead upright lives, instead of accepting a reward, corresponded with
                    the prosecutors and had the cases stricken from the records I have known of a
                    prisoner, being a strange man in a strange land, standing upon the scaffold,
                    ready to forfeit his life upon the gallows, turn to Mr. <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref> and with tears streaming down his face, say: <said>"<ref
                            target="#delahunty">Jim</ref>, don't let them cut my body to
                        pieces."</said> Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> as he shook his
                    hand and <sic>bad</sic> him a last farewell, said: <said>"No, my boy, I will see
                        that you get a Christian burial."</said> And he did. When, urged on by a
                    little gang of hypocrites, three desperadoes with murder in their hearts, set
                    out to dynamite and shoot their way out of prison, there stood the brave <ref
                        target="#delahunty">James Delahunty</ref>, the warden, and unaided fought
                    the three of them. When finally he fell to the floor mortally wounded his last
                    words were, <said>"Oh, my Lord."</said> Such a man was <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >James Delahunty</ref>. Is it a wonder that his fellow townsmen honored him
                    with public office, or that five governors placed him in a responsible position
                    in the service of the state? Or is it it strange that every convict in the
                    prison but one, signs a petition and presents it to Warden <ref target="#smith"
                        >Smith</ref> to retain Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> as
                    deputy warden?</p>
                <p>No matter how good and faithful a public officer is, he is bound to make some
                    enemies; and that same little gang of hypocrites whom he would not feed at the
                    expense of the state nor let them run the prison, poisoned the mind of the
                    public against him. Had it not been for their nefarious work, brave <ref
                        target="#delahunty">James Delahunty</ref> would still have been in the land
                    of the living.</p>

                <p>The funeral of Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> was held at nine
                    o'clock on Wednesday, March twentieth, 1912 at the <ref target="#cathedral"
                        >Catholic Cathedral</ref> in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. Solemn
                    requiem mass was held over the body. Father <ref target="#moran">Moran</ref> was
                    celebrant, Father <ref target="#dumphy">Dumphy</ref> of Sutton, deacon; Father
                        <ref target="#bradley">Bradley</ref>, sub-deacon and Father <ref
                        target="#loughlin">Loughlin</ref>, master of ceremonies. There were many
                    floral offerings. After the services were concluded the remains lay in state and
                    were viewed by hundreds of people.</p>

                <p>The church was packed. <ref target="#aldrich">Governor</ref> and Mrs. <ref
                        target="#msaldrich">Aldrich</ref>, Secretary of State Mr. <ref

                        >George</ref> and many other state, county and city officials attended. From
                    all over the state came prominent men. From <ref target="#clay">Clay</ref>
                    county came a large delegation of friends and former townsmen of the warden.
                    Father <ref target="#moran">Moran</ref>, the Catholic chaplain at the
                    penitentiary, preached the sermon. He paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of
                    the deceased warden. He declared that the warden had died as only a brave man
                    could die, in defense of the interests of the public. He thought that there
                    could be no more heroic death than to fall at the post of duty. In closing the
                    sermon he said: <said>"He will be long remembered by those who knew him, and he
                        will soon be forgotten by those who <emph>criticised (sic)</emph> him, for
                        they will be busy <emph>criticising (sic)</emph> someone else."</said></p>

                <p>The murdered deputy warden, <ref target="#wagner">Henry Wagner</ref>, had been
                    connected with the prison for over eighteen years. For many years he served as
                    guard, was then promoted to steward and rose to be the deputy warden: He was a
                    quiet, kindhearted, generous man and a good prison man. He believed in strict
                    discipline, played no favorites among the inmates who all looked alike to him.
                    Mr. <ref target="#wagner">Wagner</ref> was a widower and had no relatives in the
                    state. Mr. <ref target="#heilman">E. G. Heilman</ref>, the veteran usher, had
                    been employed at the penitentiary for over five years - first as chief clerk for
                    two years. When Warden <ref target="#smith">Smith</ref> was appointed and his
                    chief clerk did not understand the prison system of bookkeeping, Mr. <ref
                        target="#heilman">Heilman</ref> was retained as usher and looked after the
                    most of the books besides. He also served his county as clerk, and served the
                    state as assistant secretary.He was a good accountant, a fine penman and a man
                    of high education and refinement. He possessed a sunny disposition, always
                    happy, always jolly and in good humor. As a young man he fought for his country,
                    and had he not been shot down unexpectedly by the murderers' bullets, he too
                    would have given account of himself. What a pity that a good and brave man
                    should lose his life in such a manner. Mr. <ref target="#doody">Thomas
                        Doody</ref> had also been connected with the prison for many years, first as
                    guard and later on as cell keeper. He kept the big cell house clean and in good
                    condition. He is a fine fellow, good-hearted, generous and humane. The inmates
                    liked Mr. <ref target="#doody">Doody</ref>, for he treated them like men. His
                    wounds were serious and we did not expect him to live; but through the care of
                    Doctor <ref target="#spradling">Spradling</ref>, assisted by <ref
                        target="#dinsmore">Frank Dinsmore</ref>, he pulled through though crippled
                    for life.</p>

                <p>The legislature appropriated five thousand dollars for Mr. <ref target="#doody"
                        >Doody</ref> as a reward for his bravery, as well as to pay for bills
                    incurred while being sick. The relatives of Mr. <ref target="#heilman"
                        >Heilman</ref> also received a small amount. The friends and relatives of
                    all the murdered prison officials will derive comfort from the public
                    consciousness that they died faithful to the service allotted them by their
                    fellow men, and unfalteringly gave their lives to the service of society, as
                    verily as does - the soldier who falls on the field of battle in the service of
                    his country. </p>

                <p>Those were gloomy days following upon the murder of the warden. The place seemed
                    so strange and empty without him. Everybody looked sad and said but little. It
                    was indeed a sad sight to look at <ref target="#frank">Frank</ref>, the warden's
                    janitor and messenger. Every morning the colored man used to come to the office
                    and shine the warden's shoes. He entered the office in silence and left the same
                    way. To <ref target="#frank">Frank</ref>, the warden was the greatest man in the
                    world as well as his best friend. On the morning following the murder, <ref
                        target="#frank">Frank</ref> came into the office, and looking at the vacant
                    chair wept bitterly. <said>"This place is so lonesome without the warden; I wish
                        I could have gone with him,"</said> said the faithful colored man. For over
                    a week he went along with his work grief-stricken and without speaking to
                    anyone, and eating barely enough to sustain life. The following week was
                        <soCalled>"letter day"</soCalled> at the prison and nearly every inmate
                    wrote a letter. All deplored the murder of the warden and many spoke bitterly of
                    the murderers and those who instigated the murder. The following letter written
                    by a poor sick boy to his mother in <ref target="#siouxcity">Sioux City</ref>,
                        <ref target="#iowa">Iowa</ref>, is a fair example of the many that went out: </p>

                        you will ever get this letter, but I hope you do. I know that you have read
                        in the papers about the awful murder of our good <ref target="#delahunty"
                            >warden</ref>. I know that he is up among the angels in heaven now. <ref
                            target="#georgemother">Mother</ref>, I want you to know that I was
                        neither hurt nor mixed up in that awful murder. The warden was on the square
                        and we all liked him. I sat on the hospital steps the other day when he came
                        along. He walked slowly and looked as if he was worried. He asked me how I
                        felt. I told him that I was getting better, but had no appetite, that the
                        only thing I could eat was an orange, but that I had no money to buy one
                        with. He said that he would see that I got some. That same day he brought me
                        a big bag of fine oranges and told me that he would bring some more. <ref
                            target="#georgemother">Mother</ref>, I want you to pray for his mother,
                        she is so good and kind. Colonel <ref target="#presson">Presson</ref>
                        preached a fine sermon the other day, for the chaplain got fired. We have

                        from cell to cell and visited with us. He is a young man and I know that his
                        heart is not petrified. Mother, pray for me that I may live and get home in
                        August, when my time is up. Love to all, <ref target="#george"

                <p>Letters of sympathy came pouring in from all corners of the world and hundreds of
                    letters came to the inmates deploring the murder. There was grief and sorrow in
                    every place, except in <ref target="#tecumseh">Tecumseh</ref>. Never during the
                    life of the warden had the former chaplain gone to him and talked over prison
                    matters. Never had he complained to him, never had he given an interview or
                    explanation to a <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> paper - never. But when
                    the warden lay cold in death, he gives out a statement to a little socialist
                    paper way down in <ref target="#kansas">Kansas</ref>. I am not saying anything
                    against socialism for it has many good features, but I am not in sympathy with
                    those socialists, who, during a spell of over enthusiasm, go too far and become
                    anarchists, and use their sheets to uphold and further bloody murder and many
                    lesser crimes. This paper is supposed to stand for those who are poor and
                    oppressed. It was <ref target="#gray"><q>"Shorty Gray</q></ref>'s" favorite
                    paper. Poor, oppressed <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref>! What a shame to
                    land them in prison for robbing banks. Being the organ of <ref target="#gray"
                        >Gray</ref>, it did not surprise me that Chaplain <ref target="#johnson"
                        >Johnson</ref> should also make use of it. Now I have already described to
                    my readers the hyena that digs into the grave and devours the dead bodies of
                    those whom it did not have courage to attack while they were on earth. I may be
                    a low specimen of humanity, I may have many sins, but I am no grave robber, no
                    hyena. Let the dead rest in peace. For that reason I shall not say anything
                    against the publisher of the paper that contained Chaplain <ref
                        target="#johnson">Johnson's</ref> letter, as he, the publisher, lies
                        <sic>hi</sic> his grave, dead at his own hands; and furthermore, as a young
                    woman, a mere child, figures in this matter, my lips are sealed. I hope that God
                    in His tender mercy will forgive this man his sins. </p>

                <p>I wonder if my readers ever had any premonitions. I once had a premonition, when
                    as a boy I made a raid upon my <ref target="#authormother">mother</ref>'s pantry
                    and did away with a lot of jam. I had a premonition of something coming that I
                    could not shake off, and the <emph>premonitition (sic)</emph> grew stronger and
                    stronger as I saw my <ref target="authormother">mother</ref> approaching with a
                    paddle. And out in the penitentiary, an old fellow who stole a horse in <ref
                        target="#gardencounty">Garden County</ref>, told me that he, too, had a
                    premonition that he could not shake off - a <emph>premonitition (sic)</emph> of
                    something coming. He too was right, for the sheriff was coming. But, I beg to
                    apologize to my reader for getting away from my subject, the statement of
                    Chaplain <ref target="#johnson">Johnson</ref> in the little <ref
                        target="#kansas">Kansas</ref> paper. It reads as follows: </p>
                <p>
                    <q>"I resigned as chaplain of <ref target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> state
                        prison because I could no longer work with Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                            >Delahunty</ref>. His methods of dealing with prisoners and mine, were
                        materially different. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> considered a
                        prisoner not a man but a thing without rights or feelings. He believed a
                        prison a place of punishment, and I, a place of reformation. His methods
                        were brutalizing the men and making them desperate. The guards reflected his
                        spirit after convict <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> killed Deputy Warden
                            <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref>. I had a premonition of something
                        coming that I could not shake off. I could do nothing because nobody would
                        pay any attention to me. The powers that <sic>be</sic> treated me with
                        contempt. I felt that the only thing to do was to resign and let those who
                        were stubbornly insisting on having their own way assume the responsibility
                        for what would happen. <ref target="#noah">Noah</ref> preached righteousness
                        for a hundred and twenty years, but it took a deluge to move things. The
                        angel tried to save <ref target="#sodom">Sodom</ref>, but it took fire to
                        clean the city. It has taken startling events to change things at the
                        prison. All my protests against conditions were received as the vaporings of
                        a sentimental old man. My suggestions of prison reform were taken as the
                        weakness of a childish preacher. Seven men are now dead and the whole state
                        is shocked. This has changed things, and we are getting daily messages now
                        on prison reform from unexpected sources. A little of this six months ago
                        would have saved the lives of those now lying cold in death. The state
                        doesn't need new buildings half so bad as it needs a little humanity at work
                        in the ones we now have. I hated to leave my work and the poor prisoners,
                        many of whom I had learned to love, but I had to do it."</q>
                </p>

                <p>To the uninitiated, to the stranger, this sounds good; but let us analyze it and
                    see if he is right, for even preachers make blunders once in a while. If they
                    did not, there would not be so large a colony of them in <ref target="#singsing"
                        >Sing Sing</ref> prison, for it is a fact that there are more preachers
                    there than there are bar-keepers. And what are they there for? Not many are
                    there for stealing, no they are mostly there for crimes against other persons,
                    against the other sex especially, for crimes against the home. These preachers,
                    at any rate blundered, and failed to practice what they preached. I have known a
                    preacher to stand before the congregation and preach righteousness. He was taken
                    to be a holy man by all-save by one young woman, who later on sent him to the
                    place where stripes are worn. I mention this to impress upon my readers the fact
                    that preachers do make mistakes. The statement of this holy man published in the
                        <ref target="#kansas">Kansas</ref> paper is full of them. To publish a
                    statement against, a man who lies cold in death is in itself a mistake, and is a
                    cowardly act. It shows lack of broad mindedness and Christian charity. In
                    besmirching the character of our <ref target="#delahunty">departed warden</ref>,
                    he is wrong; and I will ask that my reader will turn back a few pages and read
                    the chapter entitled <q>"Our Martyred Warden."</q> That chapter tells all about
                    Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>, and I will prove that I am right.
                    Take that chapter, and at the same time the statement of the chaplain, to any of
                    the five governors that Mr. <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> served
                    under, and ask them which is right and which is wrong. Go to his home county,
                    ask those among whom he lived for nearly thirty years and ask who is correct. He
                    is right, however, where he says that he felt that the only thing to do was to
                    resign-for Governor <ref target="#aldrich"> Aldrich</ref> felt so too. He says
                    further that all his protests were received as the vaporings of a sentimental
                    old man. Where and when did he protest? Never to Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref>. In order to give this man a perfectly square deal before
                    publishing this book, I sent him on the evening of September the seventeenth, by
                    registered mail, a letter which I know that he received. In that I asked him
                    five questions which he never saw fit to answer.</p>

                <p>When the warden was brutally murdered, an <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref> paper
                    called up this chaplain by phone and asked what he thought about the murder. His
                    answer was: <quote>"I do not want to say anything just now, but I will have to
                        admit that I am not exactly surprised.</quote></p>

                <p>As soon as the men were locked in their cells following the escape of the

                    any upholstering. With two pals he burglarized the bank at <ref target="#lyons"

                    of curiosity seekers and many friends of the dynamiters attended the trial. Mr.
                        <ref target="#cole">Cole</ref> fought hard to save his clients, but after
                    hearing the testimony of a number of witnesses the court announced that to his
                    mind there was sufficient evidence to bind them over, and fixed their bail at
                    two thousand dollars, which they were unable to furnish. Fearing a rescue by
                    their friends the trio was immediately taken to <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref>
                    for safe keeping by Sheriff <ref target="#phipps">Phipps</ref> of <ref

                    while there was nothing heard of them. But again in 1911, <ref target="#gray"

                    twelve hundred dollars in coin, which they succeeded in burying before they:

                        >Aurora</ref> and were immediately taken to the penitentiary for safe
                    keeping. In July 1912 they were tried before Judge <ref target="#corcoran"

                    and received a sentence of from twenty-eight years to life in the penitentiary.

                <p> When the three murderers slipped out of the front door they disappeared as if
                    from the face of the earth. The posse scoured the country surrounding the
                    penitentiary, and ran down clew upon clew without finding even a trace of them.
                    All Thursday afternoon and night the posse kept up the search, and carefully
                    inspected all clumps of brush and woods and looked into culverts and beneath
                    bridges without results. Many dews had been run to earth but all failed; On
                    Friday morning the sheriff swore in twenty additional deputies and kept a force
                    of clerks busy sending out circulars to every officer in this and adjoining
                    states. Chief of Police <ref target="#hunger">Hunger</ref> also added several
                    special officers to his force. At <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref>, Mr. <ref

                        target="#nebraskabankers">Nebraska Bankers Association</ref>'s secret
                    service, also got busy and put out all of his men. Of all the officers in the
                    state the bank robbers fear him the most on account of his systematic and
                    never-tiring methods. Many a member of the safeblowers' colony has been
                    compelled to leave the state to operate elsewhere on account of this man. <ref

                    search with a force of railroad detectives. By Friday morning the entire eastern
                    and southern part of the state was covered by a dragnet maintained by hundreds
                    of county and police officers and thousands of private individuals. </p>

                <p>Acting under the conviction that the men were in hiding in <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref>, Chief <ref target="#hunger">Hunger</ref> and a force of men
                    kept up a search of all rooming houses of doubtful character, and the entire
                    police force kept a close watch on all suspicious characters. Friday passed by
                    and still no clew. While the search was going on everything was quiet at the
                    prison. On Friday noon, <ref target="#robb">Steward Robb</ref>, who was nearly
                    exhausted from hard work, asked the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> to be
                    relieved from the office of acting warden, and Mr. <ref target="#rwhyers">R. W.
                        Hyers</ref>, deputy game warden, and a former warden of the prison, took his
                    place. A thorough search was started at the prison commencing at the west cell
                    house. Everything in the cells except the bed clothes was taken to chapel and
                    stored there. The men were kept locked up and fed in their cells. Late on
                    Saturday night came a clew indicating movements of the three fugitives. About an
                    hour after leaving the prison they appeared at the dairy farm of <ref
                        target="dickman">Joseph Dickman</ref> at <ref target="#dickmanfarm">2709 Van
                        Dorn Street</ref>. They were first seen by the hired man, staggering through
                    the drifts of snow, and indeed were a pitiful sight, wet and almost frozen. They
                    were invited into the house, and it was then first seen that they were convicts.
                        <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> acted as spokesman for the trio, assured the
                        <ref target="msdickman">lady</ref> of the house that they were not going to
                    hurt anyone, but just wanted a shelter. She kept cool, told them that she had to
                    milk the cows, and asked them to go with her to the barn and help her with the
                    work. They said they would. <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> and <ref
                        target="#morley">Morley</ref> went with her while <ref target="#gray"
                        >Gray</ref> remained in the house and kept watch over the telephone. When
                    they entered the barn she asked them if they could milk, and they answered that
                    they could not. Then she asked one of them to go up into the silo and throw down
                    the ensilage. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> climbed up there and <ref
                        target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> filled the mangers with feed for the cows. When
                    the chores were done they returned to the house and <ref target="#dowd"
                        >Dowd</ref> pulled down the curtains. Mr. <ref target="#dickman"
                        >Dickman</ref>'s two sons returned from delivering milk, and their mother
                    told them that the convicts were in the house and for them to keep quiet and to
                    do as the men ordered. When the boys came in the murderers asked them the news
                    in town. They related what they had heard. That was the first intimation Mrs.
                        <ref target="#msdickman">Dickman</ref> had of them having committed murder. </p>

                <p>Supper was now served. <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> and <ref target="#morley"
                        >Morley</ref> sat down with the family and ate heartily while <ref
                        target="#gray">Gray</ref> went into the front room keeping vigil. When <ref

                    finished supper they went into the other room to watch and <ref target="#gray"
                        >Gray</ref> then sat down to eat. After supper they rested for a while, and
                        <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> ordered one of the boys to hitch up the
                    milkwagon and drive them to Lincoln. <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> patted the
                    horses tenderly on their shoulders and said that he hated to take the horses out
                    in such a storm. Before leaving they demanded three pairs of overalls which were
                    given them. The men then shook hands with Mrs. <ref target="#msdickman"
                        >Dickman</ref> and thanked her for her kindness. They told her not to say
                    anything about them having been there or the lives of the family would be in
                    danger. <said>"Remember,"</said> they said, <said>"your boy is with us."</said>
                    The boy was instructed to take them to <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. At
                        <ref target="#twentiethandr">Twentieth and R Streets</ref> they got off and
                    disappeared in the darkness. While driving near <ref target="#randolphstreet"
                            ><sic>Rando1ph</sic> street</ref> the wagon became stuck in the snow. A
                    kindhearted pedestrian passing by, assisted them to get out of the snow drifts.
                    This afterwards proved to Chief of Police <ref target="#hunger">Hunger</ref>,
                    homeward bound. In the meantime dews kept coming in by the score. From far away
                        <ref target="#alliance">Alliance</ref> on the west to <ref target="#omaha"
                        >Omaha</ref> on the east came clews, all of which turned out wrong. A
                    telephone message came in that the three men had been seen approaching the
                    residence of Mr. <ref target="#fedwa">Fedewa</ref> near <ref>Forty-second and
                        Vine Streets</ref>, and Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> and a posse
                    of eleven men went out there and inquired if they had seen the men. Mrs. <ref
                        target="#msfedewa">Fedewa</ref> said that they had not, and furthermore that
                    she would not give shelter to such men. <said>"I am Irish,"</said> she said.
                            <said>"<ref target="#delahunty">Jim Delahunty</ref> was a good Irishman
                        and a good friend of ours, and we think too much of him to shelter his
                        murderers. Every year I used to bring him a basket of cherries from our
                        orchard."</said> The sheriff then searched the outbuildings, and finding no
                    trace of the trio he and the posse departed. Another report came that the men
                    were hiding in the <q>"<ref target="#robberscave">Robbers Cave</ref>."</q> These
                    caves are located about two miles from the prison, and are a mecca for
                    sightseers. A squad of men under command of Captain <ref target="#kesterson"
                        >Kesterson</ref> went into these sandstone caves and searched every nook and
                    crevice in them. They also went to the ruins of an old deserted <ref
                        target="#papermill">paper mill</ref>, made a thorough search of the
                    premises, but no trace was found. Still another message came that the bandits
                    had been seen approaching a straw stack close to the residence of the <ref
                        target="#tihen">Bishop Tihen</ref>. Colonel <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref>, Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> and Detective <ref
                        target="#schmitt">Schmitt</ref> went to the stacks and instituted a thorough
                    search, but again no trace as found. Finally came a telephone message that the
                    men were seen walking the <ref target="#burlingtonrailways"><ref
                            target="#burlington">Burlington</ref> tracks</ref> ten miles out of <ref
                        target="#havelock">Havelock</ref>, heading for <ref target="#omaha"
                        >Omaha</ref>. They were reported to be under the influence of liquor and
                    were terrorizing the farmers whose homes they passed, securing food and clothes.
                    The police of <ref target="#omaha">Omaha</ref> and <ref target="#southomaha"
                        >South Omaha</ref> were notified, and Chief <ref target="#briggs"
                        >Briggs</ref> put out sentinels to intercept them in case they left the
                    railroad tracks when nearing <ref target="#southomaha">South Omaha</ref>. Early
                    Monday morning came a message that a store in <ref target="#murdock"
                        >Murdock</ref> had been broken into and some duck coats, artics, shotguns
                    and ammunition stolen. This was soon followed by another message that the
                    murderers were seen walking the railroad tracks towards <ref target="#southbend"
                        >South Bend</ref>. Immediately a posse of twenty-five civilians and a squad
                    of militia under command of Lieutenant <ref target="#gelhaar">Harry
                        Gelhaar</ref>, one of the bravest and most daring officers, started out in
                    pursuit of the fugitives in a special train. They went to <ref
                        target="#northbend">North Bend</ref> where the posse was divided. Twelve men
                    under Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> crossed the river on hand cars.
                    From here they traced the fugitives by tracks in the snow, apparently headed for
                    the <ref target="#bluntplace">
                        <ref target="#blunt">Blunt</ref> place</ref> about four miles to the north.
                    The posse arrived at the <ref target="#blunt">Blunt</ref><sic>.</sic> farm and
                    surrounded the house. The blinds were drawn and the place appeared to be
                    deserted. The posse entered and found a note written by <ref target="#gray"
                        >Gray</ref>, that read: <q>"We have taken your neighbor for a hostage. If
                        you do not follow us or report the matter, he will not be harmed."</q> It
                    was afterwards learned that the murderers, arrived at the <ref target="#blunt"
                        >Blunt</ref> home about eleven o'clock and demanded breakfast. Mrs. <ref
                        target="#msblunt">Blunt</ref>, the two-month bride of the <ref
                        target="#blunt">young farmer</ref>, invited them to sit down and wait while
                    she went to the chicken coop for some eggs. <ref target="#msblunt">She</ref>
                    stepped out the back door, going toward the chicken coop, but turned and ran
                    towards the nearest farm a mile away and phoned the alarm. It was when she
                    failed to return that the fugitives realized that they were in danger. They
                    ordered Mr. <ref target="#blunt">Blunt</ref> to hitch up the team and drive them
                    to <ref target="#albright">Albright</ref>. <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> and
                        <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> went with him to the barn to assist in
                    getting the wagon ready, while <ref target="#gray">Gray</ref> remained in the
                    house to write the note. The trio laid down in the bottom of the wagon and with
                    the <ref target="#blunt">young farmer</ref> in the seat high above the party
                    started towards the north. They were soon overtaken by the posse and now a
                    running fight began. The posse led by Fire Commissioner <ref target="#trouton"
                        >Trouton</ref>, Chief of Police <ref target="#briggs">Briggs</ref> of South
                    Omaha and Sheriffs <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> of <ref
                        target="#lancastercounty">Lancaster</ref>, and <ref target="case">Case</ref>
                    of <ref target="#sarpycounty">Sarpy</ref> Counties, kept shooting at the
                    murderers. They kept on returning the fire. Suddenly the team came to a
                    standstill and <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> jumped from the wagon with
                    both hands up in the air. Chief <ref target="#briggs">Briggs</ref> rode up to
                    the wagon and looked into it. <said>It is all off"</said> said the chief,
                        <said>"they are dead."</said>
                </p>

                <p>The tragic feature of the running fight was the killing of the young farmer, <ref
                        target="#blunt">Roy Blunt</ref>. A bullet hole an inch below the endgate of
                    the wagon showed the course of the bullet which had embedded itself in his
                    heart. The young farmer's friends took the body in charge and laid it tenderly
                    in the bottom of the wagon, a horse blanket serving as his shroud. The wagon
                    slowly drove back to his farm home, the friends on horseback following it
                    quietly and full of grief.</p>

                <head type="title">HOW THE GUNS GOT IN </head>

                <p> Heavy chains and handcuffs were put on <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref>. He
                    told the posse that <ref target="blunt">Blunt</ref> was the first man to lose
                    his life, and that <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref> was the second man
                    killed. Their death left <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> and <ref
                        target="#morley">Morley</ref> alive in the wagon, with the team without a
                    driver, racing down the road. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> kept on firing
                    at the posse, but <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref>, realizing that the fight was a
                    hopeless one, placed his gun at his right temple and killed himself. It was when
                        <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> looked around and saw that <ref
                        target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> was dead that he jumped out of the wagon, and with
                    both hands high in the air, surrendered. He was uninjured, having come through
                    the <emph>fusilade (sic)</emph> without being struck even once. With him
                    handcuffed, and the bodies of <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref> and <ref
                        target="#dowd">Dowd</ref>, the posse drove to <ref target="#gretna"
                        >Gretna</ref> and waited for a special train that had been ordered from <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. Before the train pulled out Sheriff <ref
                        target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> told the crowd that he would show them the
                    captured man and also the dead bodies. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref>
                    closely guarded was taken to the rear platform, where he stood for a while
                    looking at the crowd. The <ref target="#hyers">Sheriff</ref> asked him to say
                    something. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> said: <said>"I am sorry that <ref
                            target="#blunt">Roy Blunt</ref> was killed."</said> Then the bodies of
                        <ref target="#gray">Gray</ref> and <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref>, ghastly,
                    bleeding and awful to look upon, were held limply up to the morbid gaze of the
                    crowd. Sheriff <ref target="#hyers">Hyers</ref> told the crowd that it was he
                    who killed <ref target="#gray">Gray</ref>, and received the cheers of the crowd
                    with a pleased smile.</p>

                <p>News of the capture spread quickly, and large crowds gathered at <ref
                        target="#ashland">Ashland</ref> and <ref target="#waverly">Waverly</ref>,
                    where the bodies were again exhibited. Two stops were made at <ref
                        target="#havelock">Havelock</ref>, one at the station and one at the shops,
                    and the crowd looked upon the bodies. It became known that a very large crowd
                    was at the <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> depot, and it was ordered to run
                    the train through without stopping to the <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >penitentiary</ref>. There it stopped at the <sic>cross ing</sic>, two
                    blocks from the main entrance of the prison. The bodies of the dead desperadoes
                    were unloaded and laid by the roadside, while <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref>
                    was taken into the turnkey office. Altogether, he had enjoyed his liberty for
                    one hundred hours. He wore a corduroy cap, a duck coat with a fur collar, a
                    brown flannel shirt, and heavy' dark trousers. He was again dressed in the
                    regulation gray suit, and assigned to a solitary cell in the hole where, with
                        <ref target="#prince">Prince</ref> for a neighbor, he must remain until the
                    trial.</p>

                <p>Soon <ref target="lincoln">Lincoln</ref>'s popular coroner, Mr. <ref
                        target="#matthews"><q>"Jack"</q> Matthews</ref>, arrived at the prison. Six
                    prisoners were drafted from the east cellhouse to go out and carry in the dead
                    bodies. Three of these were lifetimers and had not been outside the prison walls
                    for many years. They brought with them a blanket. The body of <ref
                        target="#dowd">Dowd</ref> was first carried in, and that of <ref
                        target="#gray">Gray</ref> came second. <ref target="#Sgray">Gray</ref> was
                    unruly even in death, for the body seem inclined to roll off the blanket. It was
                    a ghastly sight indeed. The bodies were brought to the chapel and examined by
                    Coroner <ref target="#matthews">Matthews</ref>. He found that <ref
                        target="#gray">Gray</ref> had been shot with a rifle below the heart. <ref
                        target="dowd">Dowd</ref> had also only one wound. The bullet had entered the
                    right temple and come out the left ear. After the inquest nobody claimed the
                    bodies and they were turned over to a medical college. I understand that part of
                        <ref target="#Shorty_Gray">Shorty Gray</ref>'s body is still <soCalled>"in
                        pickle"</soCalled> at the college.</p>

                <p>Visitors at the prison gazing at the bullet holes, usually ask, <quote>"but how
                        did the guns get in here?"</quote> That question still remains unanswered.
                    On the evening following the murder, Major <ref target="#antles">Antles</ref>,
                    chief of staff to General <ref target="#phelps">Phelps</ref>, asked me that same
                    question. For an answer, I went into the vaults and brought out the convicts'
                    bank ledger and showed him the account of a safeblower. It showed where the man
                    had sent two money orders to a woman relative of <ref target="#gray">Shorty
                        Gray</ref>'s living in <ref target="lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. The account also
                        showed<sic>.</sic> where <ref target="#gray">he</ref> had given another
                    inmate, a trusty, a check for eight dollars. The first charge, in my opinion,
                    represented the money that paid for the guns, and the other, I thought was
                    payment for getting them in. The major looked over the accounts carefully and
                    asked me several questions. For a while he sat with the book before him, in deep
                    study. Then he arose and started for the inside to investigate. Just then there
                    came a report that the murderers were located and he had to get out his men and
                    start in pursuit of the fugitives. When <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> was
                    captured the question was put to him and he answered: <said>"There is only one
                        man besides me who knows that, and he won't tell."</said> But my theory
                    always was, and still is, just as I told Major <ref target="#antles"
                        >Antles</ref>. But it seems to me that the authorities, after getting the
                    murderers, were satisfied and did not care much to investigate further how the
                    guns got in.</p>

                <p>All day Friday, <ref target="#aldrich">Governor Aldrich</ref> was snowbound at
                        <ref target="#auburn">Auburn</ref>. He tried to get to <ref

                        City</ref> but did not succeed. Early Friday morning he called up the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> by long distance telephone. I answered the
                    phone. I gave the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> all the details about

                        >warden</ref> against such overwhelming odds. <said>It is sad indeed, very

                    managed to get a trxain out of <ref target="#auburn">Auburn</ref> and together
                    with Chairman <ref target="#maggi">Maggi</ref> of the board of pardons, he
                    appeared at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> bright and early Saturday
                    morning. He inspected the big <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> from one end to
                    the other and held conferences with the officials and talked with many of the
                    guards. He also went into the cell building, went from cell to cell and talked
                    with the inmates, and asked how Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>
                    had treated them. No one spoke a word against the warden, everyone deplored his
                    tragic death and many of them, added: <said>We hope they catch the

                    <said>Old Jim was on the square</said> some of them said, and others said:

                            <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref> and his two pals.</said> When
                    speaking of the warden, several of these men broke down and cried bitterly. The
                    life timers, and the long term men were especially grief-stricken.</p>
                <p>The talk with these men convinced the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> more
                    than ever that Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref> had not been
                    cruel to them. During the day he gave out a statement as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <said>I had full confidence in Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>
                        and nothing I have found during my investigation at the <ref
                            target="#prison">prison</ref> has shaken it.</said>
                </p>

                <p>I found no general discontent among the prisoners. Any disinterested person
                    passing down the line could hear just one sentiment - that of universal regret
                    over the untimely fate of the warden and his assistants. It is positively and
                    undoubtedly true, as I believe, that the criticisms which have been showered
                    upon the penitentiary management were instrumental in rendering discipline at
                    the institution less stringent than it would otherwise have been. Some
                    safeguards were removed which should have been continued in force. If any proper
                    criticism is to be made of Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty's</ref>
                    administration, it would be that too much leniency was shown the convicts and
                    that was probably due in part to his desire not to offend public sentiment, in
                    view of the stories which have been published about harsh treatment of the
                    men.</p>
                <p>
                    <said>I am convinced that there has been no extreme punishment at the <ref
                            target="#prison">prison</ref> for the last ten years. So far as general
                        methods are concerned, those of Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                            >Delahunty's</ref> administration are simply a continuance of those
                        under former regimes and some of the assistants have been there for fifteen
                        and twenty years.</said>
                </p>
                <p>The <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> also made a long list of
                    recommendations, including a reformatory for the first offenders, a separate
                    residence for the warden outside the walls, segregation and classification of
                    the convicts, enlarged and more modern buildings, an alarm system and up-to-date
                    gates and locks. He also announced that he would appoint as warden, a man who
                    possesses much executive and administrative ability, who will be firm and yet
                    kind.</p>
                <p>I always was, and always shall be, a great admirer of Governor <ref
                        target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref>. As a man, he is true, good and sincere; as
                    a governor, he worked hard and earnestly for the public welfare; to him
                    everybody, rich and poor, looked alike. Notwithstanding the heavy burdens placed
                    upon him, burdens heavier than ever placed upon any of our governors before, he
                    overcame all obstacles and solved all problems, and gave <ref target="#nebraska"
                        >Nebraska</ref> the best administration it ever had. He will long be
                    remembered as a governor for all the people.</p>
                <p>The little army of soulsavers that his prison warden refused to feed at the
                    expense of the state, were, of course, opposed to the <ref target="#aldrich"
                        >governor</ref>, and the lies that they scattered broadcast about the
                    atrocities at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, lost the <ref
                        target="#aldrich">governor</ref> many votes, likewise did the division of
                    the Republican party. In one of those landslides that comes every so often, and
                    puts a democrat in office, he went down to temporary defeat, to rise again
                    before long to a still higher office. He is today the strongest Republican in
                    the state. Those who turned against him realize their mistake and regret it.
                    Were the elections to be held over again now, he would sweep the country.</p>
                <p>In the office of the chief clerk at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, hangs
                    a large picture of Governor <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref>. There were
                    also pictures of him on the walls of the other offices, but it was astonishing
                    to see how quickly they were taken down. One of the officials, a turncoat, a
                    two-faced skate, even sent down to <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> for a
                    picture of the democratic governor-elect, on the day after election. He got it
                    and hung it over his desk. When the democrats came smelling around and were
                    telling about <q>what we are going to do when we take possession</q> this man
                    used to tell how he had supported Mr. <ref target="#morehead">Morehead</ref>. He
                    managed to hold his fifty dollar job and is at the height of his glory.</p>
                <p>But the picture of the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> remained upon the
                    walls of my office. When Mr. <ref target="#fenton">Fenton</ref>, the democratic
                    warden, took possession he suggested that <said>we take Aldrich down and put
                            <ref target="#morehead">Morehead</ref> up.</said> I told him that it was
                    not a matter of politics with me but the picture hung there on account of my
                    admiration of the governor's personality, and besides, it was a present to me
                    from the late Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty</ref>, and for these
                    reasons I would like to have the picture hang there as long as I was in office.
                    The new warden is a gentleman in every sense of the word, a man who respects the
                    feelings of others. He said: <said>Well, that is all right, you keep Governor
                            <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref> in your office but I will put up
                        Governor <ref target="#morehead">Morehead</ref> in mine.</said></p>

                <p>Usually when a new governor takes office, there comes from all corners of the
                    state a small army of patriots to offer their services to the state. Scores of
                    them cast their eyes longingly upon the office of the prison warden and move
                    heaven and earth to land that office. But after the assassination of the deputy
                    warden, the murder of the warden and the two officials, and the wounding of
                    still another, these patriots were noted by their absence. They were not anxious
                    at all to expose themselves to the assassin's dagger or the murderer's guns. On
                    the seventeenth Governor <ref target="#aldrich">Aldrich</ref> announced the
                    appointment of <ref target="#melick">Mr. S. M. Melick</ref>, of <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, to the office of prison warden. <said>I
                        believe that <ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref> is competent to
                        discharge the duties of the warden,</said> said the <ref target="#aldrich"
                        >governor</ref>, <said>and that he will make a good officer. He is now in
                        charge.</said></p>

                <p>The president of a national bank in <ref target="#gage">Gage</ref> county
                    appeared to think the same, for he wrote a letter as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <said>Please permit me to congratulate the state for securing so competent a man
                        for warden of our <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, as well as to
                        compliment the <ref target="#aldrich">governor</ref> for his ability in
                        securing a five-thousand dollar man for a two-thousand dollar
                        position.</said>

                <p><ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref> has been deputy sheriff and sheriff of

                    well as chief of police of <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> for many years.
                    He was known as the most active man that ever held these offices. He is a man of
                    fine appearance, large and powerful, and as brave as a lion. To look at him you
                    would say that he was a natural born sheriff or warden. He has come in contact
                    with hundreds of criminals and knows them;' and they know him, too. He has
                    transported some' of the most notorious criminals to and from <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, many of whom were not handcuffed or
                    chained, for he dislikes to expose a prisoner to the gaze of the curious. Among
                    those that he transported were <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref> and his two
                    pals, <ref target="#forbes">Forbes</ref> and <ref target="#evans">Evans</ref>.
                    Following their capture after blowing the bank at <ref target="#giltner"
                        >Giltner</ref>, and fearing that their friends might rescue them, the
                    authorities at <ref target="#aurora">Aurora</ref> decided to place them in the
                    penitentiary for safe keeping. Colonel <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>,
                    representing the Nebraska Bankers Association, went to take them to <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. The robbers were unknown to the officers at
                        <ref target="#aurora">Aurora</ref>, but when <ref target="#melick">Mr.
                        Melick</ref> walked into the jail he recognized in one of them an old time
                    acquaintance, <ref target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref>. Several years ago <ref
                        target="#gray">Shorty</ref> had been arrested by <ref target="#melick">Mr.
                        Melick</ref> and had remained as his guest for some weeks at the county
                    jail. <said>Pretty tough luck, <ref target="#gray">Shorty</ref>,</said> was <ref
                        target="#melick">Mr. Melick's</ref> greeting to his former charge.
                        <said>Darned tough luck, <ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref>,</said> said
                        <ref target="#gray">Shorty</ref>. Large crowds gathered at the station along
                    the line to see the bank robbers, but <ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref>
                    took them back into the Pullman and pulled down the curtains, and thus kept them
                    from the gaze of the curious throngs. This shows the humanity of the man. The
                    dynamiters showed their appreciation by acting like men and making no trouble of
                    any kind. Upon their arrival in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> they were
                    hurried into a large automobile and quickly landed behind the gray walls of <ref
                        target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>. When the convicts heard of the
                    appointment of <ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref> they were curious to know
                    all about him. Way up on gallery C sat an old fellow who was serving from one to
                    ten years for burglary. <said>I know him well,</said> said this old burglar,
                        <said>for he brought me from <ref target="#sacramento">Sacramento</ref> to
                            <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> once. I laid up in that jail a long
                        time trying to beat the case, and believe me, that he was a feeder.</said>
                    For the benefit of those of my readers who are unfamiliar with the criminal
                    vocabulary, I will explain, that the criminals rate the sheriffs in two classes.
                    One class are the <soCalled>feeders,</soCalled> and the other class are the
                        <soCalled>stomach robbers.</soCalled> The first feed well, but the others
                    instead of giving the prisoners sufficient to eats draw the money from the
                    county and divert the most of it to their own benefit. News travels fast in the
                        <ref target="#prison">penitentiary</ref>, although they are not permitted to
                    talk from cell to cell, yet their exists a kind of mental telepathy or a
                    wireless, telegraph system in there. Before long it was known in every cell what
                    the old burglar had said. Thus before taking charge, the new warden had the good
                    will of the boys in gray, and they anxiously looked forward to his coming.</p>
                <p>He came, and accompanied by Chairman <ref target="#maggi">Maggi</ref> of the
                    pardon board, called on the inmates right away. From cell to cell he went and
                    shook hands with the prisoners. He talked with them freely, and many of them
                    told him of their troubles. He listened to all they had to say, and it seemed as
                    if he inspired hope in their hearts. Many of the boys told him that they
                    deplored Warden <ref target="#delahunty">Delahunty's</ref> tragic death, and
                    that they were not in sympnthy (sic) with the murderers. Several of the boys
                    knew the warden and expressed pleasure at seeing him. He told them all that he
                    wanted to treat them on the square, and that he expected the square deal in
                    return. All assured him that they would do right and act like men. The next step
                    for the new warden to take was to meet the officials and guards. These he
                    weighed, and found many of them wanting. For instance, three were paralyzed,
                    three others were cripples, and some were too old to be of any service - several
                    were drunkards. These were given their checks, as was Turnkey <ref
                        target="#pahl">Claus Pahl</ref>, who in the hour of trouble, turned the keys
                    of the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> over to the desperadoes and then went
                    into hiding in the cellar. The turnkey post is an important one. He must be a
                    strong, sober man possessing good judgment, and one who can be depended on in
                    case of an outbreak. It took several days to find such a man. In the meantime
                    Colonel <ref target="#branson">C. M. Branson</ref>, one out of several business
                    men who came forward to lend a hand in the hour of trouble, took charge of the
                    keys. The board of public lands and buildings held a meeting, and it was decided
                    to increase the pay of the guards to fifty dollars a month. Previously the pay
                    had been only thirty dollars a month. No wonder that the <ref target="#prison"
                        >penitentiary</ref> became a clearing house for human derelicts, for only
                    such would work for such a small wage. The board also permitted the warden to
                    make additional expenditures for better food. On the second day the new warden
                    went over the books carefully and looked over the expenditures of the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref>. He read the report of former Warden <ref
                        target="#smith">Smith</ref>, who estimated a deficiency of about ten
                    thousand dollars in the maintenance fund, which, together with the now increased
                    salaries and unforeseen expenses on account of the outbreak, he foresaw would go
                    much higher. He realized that he must watch every expenditure and save every
                    penny that possibly could be saved. He paid much attention to the coal and meat
                    bills and set out to watch these from the start. He found the bookkeeping method
                    unsatisfactory, and demanded a daily balance sheet of each fund that he might
                    tell at any time the exact financial condition of the <ref target="#prison"
                        >prison</ref>. In order to get started off right he called for the state
                    auditor to audit the books. Mr. <ref target="#tufleys">J. W. Tufleys</ref>,
                    expert accountant for the state, came over and gave them a thorough examination.
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> felt that he could master the
                    situation thoroughly so the militia was now withdrawn. The cells were opened,
                    and after nearly two weeks of confinement the men marched again together to the
                    dining room. One by one the shops started in to operate and soon everything
                    assumed its usual appearance. The warden, who knew from experience that in order
                    to work a man must be fed, had engaged Mr. <ref target="#walsh">Andrew C.
                        Walsh</ref>, a practical and experienced man, for dining room
                    superintendent. Mr. <ref target="#walsh">Walsh</ref> was chef for a while for
                    the officers in command of our army in the <ref target="#philippines"
                        >Philippines</ref>, and is as good a chef as he is a brave soldier. He
                    possesses three medals for bravery while fighting in the <ref
                        target="#philippines">Philippines</ref>. Under him the dining room
                    progressed as it never did before. Much better food was served. Mr. <ref
                        target="#walsh">Wals</ref> saw that it was thoroughly prepared and seasoned,
                    and absolutely clean. Hitherto all the food was cooked by steam. The warden,
                    knowing how quickly the human stomach tires of steam cooked food, installed a
                    large kitchen range, that the boys might be served with fried meats and
                    potatoes. I wish my reader could have seen the look on the faces of those
                    prisoners one evening when they walked in and sat down to a supper of fried meat
                    and fried potatoes. They were more than pleased, for hitherto the potatoes had
                    been served with the jackets on and many of them were not thoroughly cooked.
                    From now on the potatoes were served in many styles: browned, German and French
                    fried, and potato cakes. Many new dishes, never before served were now added to
                    the bill of fare. Vegetables were served in abundance, and once in a while
                    fruit. It is a fact that these boys were better fed than half of the laboring
                    men in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>; and the old saying that <q>the way
                        to a man's heart is via his stomach</q> manifested itself, for the boys
                    behaved splendidly and were anxious to show the warden that they appreciated his
                    kindness.</p>
                <p>The <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> had a band of seven pieces, equipped with
                    old, delapidated (sic) instruments. This band <ref target="#melick">Mr.
                        Melick</ref> set out to reorganize and enlarge; but alas, there were no
                    funds for such a purpose. Many of the inmates came forward and joined the band
                    and bought their own instruments. A collection was taken up among the inmates,
                    friends of the prisoners, the warden contributed more and the band went in debt
                    for still more. The band, by this time was christened <q>The Melick Concert
                        Band,</q> in honor of its originator. It consisted of twenty-two men
                    equipped with the very best and most up-to-date instruments and became as
                    popular as any band in the state. The members were clad in snow-white uniforms
                    during the summer months, and cadet blue uniforms trimmed with broad black
                    braid, during the winter months. During the State Fair week, when over thirteen
                    thousand people visited the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, it attracted
                    much attention. Many favorable comments were passed, and small coins, to the
                    amount of three hundred and twenty-five dollars, were dropped into the
                    contribution box. From this fund the debts of the band were paid and many new
                    instruments and music purchased.</p>
                <p>Now came another surprise for the inmates. As they walked into the dining room
                    one evening, there was the band to play for them during the evening meal. The
                    boys were delighted, and indeed they had reason to be, for no other hotel in
                        <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> furnished such splendid table music.
                    From that day on, and all during Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick's</ref>
                    administration, the band played during the evening meal. The warden codsidered
                    (sic) music one of the foremost factors in maintaining prison discipline, a
                    factor more beneficial than anything else. During his tenure, music became one
                    of the most predominating features of the life at <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >Lancaster</ref>.</p>
                <p>Following the outbreak, all newspapers containing any news about the murder were
                    confiscated and not sent inside to the prisoners. The inmates are great readers
                    and subscribe for the dailies and weeklies published in <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref>. In addition, they received by every mail about one hundred
                    and fifty metropolitan and county newspapers, and many magazines. The boys were
                    longing for news from the outside world and were delighted when Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref> raised the ban upon the papers. There are
                    prisons where newspapers are contraband at any time and are as carefully
                    excluded as are opium and morphine. Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>
                    was not in favor of this system. On the contrary, he felt that the newspapers
                    were of benefit to him, and he thought that what was beneficial to him ought not
                    to seriously injure his men. Not even the yellow journals were excluded, nor
                    were their associate muck rakers, the magazines, kept from coming in. The warden
                    thought that even these do a world of good in uncovering frauds and wrongs in
                    high places, and in driving powerful wrongdoers to cover; and when their work is
                    completed, the smaller will not have the example of those higher up in life to
                    justify them in crime. He felt that the desire for these papers was better than
                    no desire at all, that when the prisoners read these their mind was occupied,
                    and that the time passed so much quicker for them. Not only to the inmates did
                    the warden consider the newspapers of immeasurable value, as mighty factors in
                    maintaining discipline, but to the institution as well. The prisoners received
                    his order for unrestricted entrance into the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>,
                    of all newspapers and periodicals, with much pleasure. An unrestricted mail was
                    another feature that Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> permitted that
                    aided him much in his work. While the prisoners were formerly permitted to write
                    only one letter a week, they were now permitted to write special ones and to
                    receive as many as the letter carrier brought. Good books the warden also
                    considered a great factor in maintaining the prison discipline, as well as great
                    educational factors. The library was thoroughly overhauled and cleaned, the
                    books were classified and listed, and many scientific and practical handbooks
                    were added; books that teach men to do things in life - how to build houses, how
                    to run machinery, how to mix concrete, books on electricity and many other
                    practical books that benefit and strengthen the readers and fit them to better
                    cope with the practical bread-and-butter part of life, when the big steel gate
                    swings open to them. To those who prefer fiction, it is there in abundance.
                    Hitherto the rule had been to allow one book to each inmate per week, but now
                    this rule was changed, and if a book was finished before the week was up,
                    another one was brought in its place; thus the men were never with out good
                    reading. The reorganized library consisted of books as follows:</p>

                <p>In addition to these books, subscriptions were placed for all the leading
                    magazines and many trade papers. Hundreds of magazines were also donated by
                    private individuals, and many periodicals were sent to the <ref target="#prison"
                        >prison</ref> by Assistant Postmaster <ref target="#ludlam">Ludlam</ref> of
                        <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>. These were the uncalled for
                    periodicals.</p>
                <p>Instead of destroying them they were sent to <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >Lancaster</ref> and distributed among the inmates, read and re-read, and
                    gave the boys much pleasure. Everything that would elevate and educate the human
                    mind found favor with Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>. Several of the
                    inmates took correspondence courses in law, pharmacy, electricity and
                    engineering, and went out well qualified to fill good positions. Theatricals
                    were given at intervals, a stringed orchestra and several quartettes were
                    organized, and new members were added to the choir which was as good as many a
                    choir in the fashionable churches in <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>.
                    Baseball and football became favorite sports with the boys, but the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> is sadly in need of a park for outdoor sports.
                    School was held in the evenings under the direction of Chaplain <ref
                        target="#harmon">Harmon</ref>, assisted by six of the better educated
                    inmates. Many a man came in illiterate and went out able to read and write,
                    while others improved most wonderfully. Many lecturers were secured by <ref
                        target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref>, some of national reputation. On June the
                    second, 1912, William J. Bryan delivered his famous lecture <q>The Making of a
                        Man.</q> Other lecturers were <ref target="#metcalf">Governor Metcalf</ref>,
                    Doctor Bixby, William Maupin, Chief Justice Reese, Attorney Wolfenbarger,
                    Colonel Presson, Mrs. Bessie Gerhart Morrison, Mrs. Leila English and Miss
                    Richardson, known froth coast to coast as <q>the flag lady,</q> Rev. F. L.
                    Wharton of Pittsburg, Senator Burkett, Mrs. Jackson, President of the W. C. T.

                <p>Is there such a thing as honor among thieves? Indeed there is. Charles Reade in
                    his famous book, <q>It is Never Too Late to Mend,</q> speaks of a little girl
                    who came to see a thief just captured. <q>Oh dear,</q> she said, <q>I couldn't
                        have told it from a man.</q> And a thief, although a thief, is still a man.
                    Overlooking the blunder that he has made; like any other man, he is sure to have
                    honor within his heart. Well, who will believe a convicted felon? Who will
                    believe in his word of honor? Read a little further into this chapter and you
                    will know.</p>
                <p>Everything moved along nicely at <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>. The
                    boys had plenty of good and well prepared food; they had much music, many
                    entertainments, and plenty of good reading matter. Hearth that formerly were
                    filled with despair were now full of hope. Faces that used to look sad and
                    gloomy were now smiling. All the way through the, boys were happy, in good
                    spirits, and turning out more work than ever before. There was never even a
                    semblance of a riot after Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> took charge;
                    and I believe that if one had been attempted, ninety-seven per cent of the
                    inmates would have aided in putting it down. <said>There won't be an outbreak as
                        long as <ref target="#melick">Mr. Melick</ref> is warden,</said> said a long
                    time safe: blower to me. <said>The boys appreciate what he is doing for them,
                        and will not impose upon him.</said> And now came the honor system,
                    something unknown in the <ref target="#prison">Nebraska prison</ref> but applied
                    in a few other prisons. Credit should be given to <ref target="#tynan">Thomas J.
                        Tynan</ref>, warden of the <ref target="#colorado">Colorado</ref> prison,
                    for being the first to use this method. Like the <ref target="#nebraska"
                        >Nebraska</ref> warden, he feels that the prisoners are human beings and
                    will respond to human treatment the same as other humans. The methods of Warden
                        <ref target="#tynan">Tynan</ref>, of sending men unguarded to the road
                    camps, which were also unguarded, are known the world over.</p>
                <p>Other wardens such as <ref target="#arizona">Robert B. Sims</ref>, of <ref
                        target="#arizona">Arizona</ref> penitentiary, Warden <ref target="#sanders"
                        >Sanders</ref> of <ref target="#iowa">Iowa</ref> penitentiary, and Warden
                        <ref target="#codding">Codding</ref> of <ref target="#kansas">Kansas</ref>
                    prison, have applied the honor system with much success. Governor <ref
                        target="#west">West</ref> of <ref target="#oregon">Oregon</ref> takes a
                    great interest in prison work, and the honor system is now used at the <ref
                        target="#oregon">Oregon</ref> prison. From far away <ref target="#hawaii"
                        >Hawaii</ref>, Governor <ref target="#frear">Frear</ref> has just sent his
                    private secretary, Mr. <ref target="#courtney">Norman Courtney</ref>, to
                    investigate the methods used at the <ref target="#oregon">Oregon</ref> prison,
                    with the result that before long the honor system will be introduced throughout
                    the <ref target="#hawaii">Hawaiian Islands</ref>. Warden <ref target="#homer"
                        >William J. Homer</ref> of <ref target="#greatmeadowsprison">Great Meadows
                        Prison</ref> at <ref target="#comstock">Comstock</ref>, <ref
                        target="#newyork">New York</ref>, must also be added to this list. He has
                    recently taken charge of the sixty mutinous convicts from <ref
                        target="#singsing">Sing Sing</ref>, has put them on their honor and they are
                    doing nicely. There were several idle men at <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >Lancaster</ref>, and the farmers were clamoring for men. The <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> planted a larger area in vegetables than ever
                    before and a larger force of men went to work there. Several men were out
                    singlehanded to work on the farms, while others went in gangs, some with and
                    some without guards. Before selecting a man for farm work the warden called the
                    man to his office and talked with him for a while. He asked him if he would give
                    him his word of honor not to escape, and explained to him that to be a trusty
                    was a stepping stone to a parole and final release; while on the other hand to
                    escape meant to forfeit his good time when recaptured. Altogether this honor
                    system was a success During the harvest months these trusties earned nearly five
                    hundred dollars for the state, quite a sum of money for themselves, besides
                    being out in the open and enjoying their liberty.</p>
                <p>The boys in gray possess honor as well as the men on the outside, which is shown
                    in the case of an inmate serving from one to twenty years. When he heard that
                    his father lay dead out in his little home town in the western part of the
                    state, he went to Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> and, with tears in
                    his eyes, pleaded that he be permitted to attend the last rites over the body.
                    For quite a while he and the warden talked, it over.</p>
                <p><said>And do you give me your word of honor that you will return by
                        Friday?</said> asked the warden. <said>I do,</said> said the prisoner. He
                    went, and on Friday, true to his word, the word of an outcast, walked into the
                    office of the warden and delivered himself up. While on the way to the funeral,
                    as the familiar scenes flashed by, he must have bitterly thought of the irony of
                    fate. A free man for the time being, because of the death of one who was near
                    and dear to him. At the services he must have seen a smirk in the smile of his
                    old neighbors. The stares of his former friends must have been hateful to his
                    sight. After it was all over, after he had bid his wife and babies a tender
                    farewell, he must return to a long life of disgrace and solitude. Why not leave
                    the train at one of the stops and flee for his liberty? Why pay the heavy toll
                    which society demanded? He could soon be in another state where, under another
                    name, he could begin life anew. But the promise given to Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref>, which was the only link that held him on the
                    return journey, proved stronger than all the chains in the world. The twilight
                    found him again behind those gray stone walls of <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >Lancaster</ref> that surround hundreds of other aching hearts.</p>
                <p>This man was, to all appearances, an innocent man, one of the several that serve
                    at <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref> for a crime committed by somebody
                    else. He afterwards became the warden's coYachman, and later on worked around my
                    office. It was while filling these positions of trust that he managed to prove
                    his innocence and was sent home.</p>
                <p>I recall a similar case. The superintendent of the state hospital at <ref
                        target="#kearney">Kearney</ref> wired Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref> that their chef had been taken ill, and asked him for the loan
                    of one for a few weeks. The warden sent for a young man working in the guard's
                    kitchen, and asked him if he would like to make the trip. He was much surprised,
                    and gave the warden his word of honor that he would do right. The following day
                    his mother came to visit him, and she was also much surprised. She thanked
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, and said that she did not know how to
                    repay him. <said>Madam,</said> said the warden, <said>you can repay me by
                        writing your son a letter telling him to be true to his word.</said> She
                    did, but it was not necessary, for about a week later this young man,
                    unannounced, walked into the Warden's office. There was a happy look on his
                    face. He told the warden that the chef had returned to his post and his work
                    gave out, therefore he came back. The warden shook hands with him and said:
                        <said>You have acted like a man.</said> He soon became the warden's chef and
                    admitted to parole. Now and then I get a letter from him. He is in South <ref
                        target="#omaha">Omaha</ref>, is saving his money, and is in every way a
                    model citizen. I also recall the case of <ref target="#bwilliams">Billy
                        Williams</ref>, an expert boilermaker who was serving a long sentence. At
                    the time the new boilers and stokers were installed, he was put in charge of the
                    installation. Besides the value of his labor, he saved the state hundreds of
                    dollars by his valuable suggestions. He was also sent to the hospital at <ref
                        target="#kearney">Kearney</ref> and went unattended. He gave good
                    satisfaction there. For his efficient and faithful service, Mrs. <ref
                        target="#barker">Barker</ref>, the superintendent of the hospital, wrote
                    several letters to the board of pardons, asking them to act favorably in his
                    case. While at <ref target="#kearney">Kearney</ref> he made friends with several
                    of the leading men of that town, who added the weight of their word to the
                    application for a pardon. Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> also
                    appeared before the board in his behalf, and finally a pardon was granted. He
                    located in <ref target="#colorado">Colorado</ref>, opened a shop of his own and
                    prospered.</p>
                <p>When <ref target="#bwilliams">Williams</ref> was pardoned the hospital at <ref
                        target="#kearney">Kearney</ref> needed another man and <ref
                        target="#martindale">Frank Martindale</ref> was sent over there. <ref
                        target="#martindale">Martindale</ref> was assistant to the master mechanic
                    of the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> and one of the handiest men with tools
                    that I ever saw. Once a small private safe of my own refused to open, and after
                    working on it for a long time I sent for <ref target="#martindale"
                        >Martindale</ref>. He looked at the lock for a few minutes, went out for a
                    wire and quickly opened the safe. We disliked to let him go, but he deserved it.
                    He, too went without a guard, and worked hard and faithfully. About a month
                    alter going to <ref target="#kearney">Kearney</ref>, he asked permission to go
                    to the bedside of his dying mother who lived in an adjoining state. He was
                    granted permission; again he made a long journey without a guard. <said>That is
                        the last you will ever see of <ref target="#martindale"
                        >Martindale</ref>,</said> said one of the guards. But on the day set for his
                    return, in walked <ref target="#martindale">Martindale</ref>. He told the warden
                    that his mother was getting better. I told him what the guard had said, and said
                    that I was glad to see him live up to his promise. He answered that he would
                    rather lose his right arm than break his word to Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref>. He was later paroled, became a contractor and builder, and
                    now has several men working for him.</p>
                <p>That a prisoner working out on a farm should ask to come back to the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> seems strange, but it has happened. On an
                    August day a paroled prisoner asked Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> if
                    he could come back <said>home.</said> The <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>
                    fare, he told Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, is many times better
                    than the food served on the farm. Especially he longed for one of those Sunday
                    dinners. He was given permission to come <soCalled>home,</soCalled> was put to
                    work in the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> garden for a few days, then a
                    better place was found for him on a dairy farm where he worked until his
                    sentence expired. He came to the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> to bid us
                    good-bye, dressed in a tailor made suit, had a ticket for his old home in <ref
                        target="#michigan">Michigan</ref> and about sixty dollars in money. <said>I
                        am going home to my old mother in <ref target="#michigan">Michigan</ref>,
                        and I am going to stay there.</said></p>
                <p>He afterwards wrote me a letter stating that he was getting along nicely, was
                    owner of a fine big team and a transfer business. He also wrote that as long as
                    he lived, he will never forget Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> and the
                    kind treatment received at his hands. He tells me how it caused him to undergo a
                    change for the better and made him again a man.</p>
                <p>I could state many similar cases but space does not permit. Taken as a whole,
                    Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick's</ref> honor system was a success from the
                    start and well worth adopting in every prison throughout the land. Several
                    wardens have come forward and given it a trial. As this book goes to press, we
                    learn of Warden <ref target="#allen">Allen</ref> of the <ref
                        target="#jolietpenitentiary"><ref target="#joliet">Joliet</ref>
                        penitentiary</ref> starting out a gang of men on honor to do road work. From
                    all over the country and from many metropolitan papers came requests for
                    information as to the methods he used to bring about his success. The answer
                    was: <q>Give the boys plenty of good food, clean, and well prepared; give them
                        work, but do not overwork them; and above all things, treat them like
                        men.</q> Several clubs and societies in this and other states have invited
                    him to attend banquets and meetings to speak on the <soCalled>honor
                        system.</soCalled> He replied most courteously, but regretted that time did
                    not permit him to attend. He felt that he was being paid by the state of <ref
                        target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref> for running the <ref target="#prison"
                        >penitentiary</ref>, and that was a duty that he could not attend to at a
                    distance.</p>

                <p>There must be discipline among the officers and guards as well as among the
                    inmates. Formerly the recommendation of some high politican (sic) was sufficient
                    to get a position at the pen. But the board of public lands and buildings had
                    sanctioned increased salaries and the employment of more men; and while it
                    became an unpleasant task for Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> to
                    discharge the old and crippled guards, safety and precaution demanded it, and
                    they were replaced with younger and more active men, better qualified for the
                    service. According to the warden's ideas a prison officer must be a man of high
                    character, fairly well educated and a judge of humanity. He must obey orders
                    from his superiors, likewise the inmates must obey him. He should be a man of
                    good appearance, kind but firm and thoroughly schooled in self control.</p>
                <p>As Napoleon rode at the head of his armies through <ref target="#egypt"
                        >Egypt</ref> past the pyramids, he halted and said: <q>Soldiers, from the
                        summit of these pyramids, forty centuries look down upon you.</q> And the
                    warden, within his castled home at <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>
                    called each new officer before him and discussed prison discipline with him,
                    gave him his instructions and pointed out to him that from those depths of crime
                    and despair nearly four hundred unfortunates look up to him for example and
                    guidance, and that he should not let them look in vain.</p>
                <p>But to reorganize a prison takes time. All the employees cannot be dismissed at
                    the same time and replaced with new men, for that would be unsafe and flirting
                    with an outbreak. A new deputy warden, Major <ref target="#antles">H. H.
                        Antles</ref> had been appointed, and a new office created, that of assistant
                    deputy warden. Mr. <ref target="#burke">John Burke</ref>, a guard, was appointed
                    to the office. The warden gave orders that the south door leading from the
                    chapel into</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic url="pg 325 ch 36.png"/>
                    <figDesc>This is an image of Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>, Deputy
                        Warden <ref target="#kavanaugh">Kavanaugh</ref>, <ref target="#morley"
                            >Morley</ref>, and Sheriff <ref target="#daly">Daly</ref></figDesc>
                </figure>
                <p>the yard must be locked at all times, and only one inmate admitted to the chapel
                    at a time. Had this rule been in force on the day of the murder, only one of the
                    desperadoes could have gotten into the chapel, and perhaps they would have
                    chosen some other route. The reason that they were open on that day was not due
                    to negligence on anyone's part, but because that by keeping the door open the
                    salary of the chapel turnkey could be saved. Such an officer was now appointed;
                    and Mr. <ref target="#cavanaro">A. Cavanaro</ref> of <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref> was chosen to fill the office. Mr. <ref target="#cavanaro"
                        >Cavanaro</ref> is a gentleman of high education, has traveled extensively,
                    and is well fitted for that kinds of work. An assistant yardmaster, Mr. <ref
                        target="#gross">Roy Gross</ref>, and an assistant farm superintendent, Mr.
                        <ref target="#seuferlein">George Seuferlein</ref>, both of whom favored
                    strict discipline and yet were kind and humane, were added to the force. Mr.
                        <ref target="#moore">Oscar Moore</ref>, for many years a prison official and
                    a man of humanity and efficiency, was given charge of the <ref target="#prison"
                        >prison</ref> cell buildings at night, and they became more quiet than ever
                    before. Of the new guards appointed, I wish to mention Mr. <ref
                        target="#johnson">Arthur Johnson</ref>, a good man and a good prison man as
                    well. <ref target="#kavanaugh">Mr. D. G. Kavanaugh</ref>, a former prison
                    official, was also called back, and took charge of the men in the chair shops.
                    He is a strong democrat. In a race for sheriff of <ref target="#saunders"
                        >Saunders county</ref>, a republican stronghold, he came within a dozen
                    votes of his republican rival, Mr. <ref target="#daly">Daly</ref>. Elsewhere in
                    this book is shown a picture of <ref target="#kavanaugh">Mr. Kavanaugh</ref> and
                    Mr. <ref target="#daly">Daly</ref>, taken on the courthouse steps at <ref
                        target="#wahoo">Wahoo</ref>. But politics were not a factor in this matter.
                        <ref target="#kavanaugh">Mr. Kavanaugh's</ref> record as an efficient prison
                    man is what brought him back. Again he proved successful. His friends were
                    pleased to learn of his appointment as assistant deputy warden by Mr. <ref
                        target="#fenton">Fenton</ref>. Then there were Mr. <ref target="#price">D.
                        E. Price</ref>, of <ref target="#phillips">Phillips</ref>, Mr. <ref
                        target="#thompson">C. Thompson</ref>, Mr. <ref target="#griffin">J. M.
                        Griffin</ref>, of <ref target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, and Mr. <ref
                        target="#johnson">L. E. Johnson</ref>, of <ref target="#raymond"
                        >Raymond</ref>, all new' officers who proved themselves very successful in
                    the handling of the inmates, and by kindness and humanity got back more work out
                    of them than did their predecessors. Mr. <ref target="#johnson">Johnson</ref>
                    afterwards succeeded Mr. <ref target="#walsh">Walsh</ref> as dining room
                    superintendent, and kept the dining room and kitchen as clean as a pin. An
                    assistant physician was added that the men could have medical attention at any
                    time, day or night. This office was filled by Doctor <ref target="#gifford">M.
                        Gifford Welch</ref>, who worked hard to save the wounded prison officials.
                    He was later on succeeded by Doctor Ward Hedlund, of <ref target="#lincoln"
                        >Lincoln</ref>. This competent doctor made a great success, especially at
                    surgery. He was on the job early and late and made a fine record. He left for
                    the western part of the state to practise (sic) medicine. He was succeeded by
                    Doctor <ref target="#humphrey">H. H. Humphrey</ref>, of Western, who also made
                    quite a reputation as a surgeon. Of the guards already in the service, <ref
                        target="#berry">Mr. Charles Berry</ref> was retained. Mr. <ref
                        target="#berry">Berry</ref> has for years been in charge of Factory
                        <q>C,</q> and has not reported any inmates for punishment for many years.
                    Mr. <ref target="#berry">Berry</ref> runs his factory by the golden rule
                    principle, and the men in return treat him on the square.</p>
                <p>Taken as a whole, Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref> had a good force of
                    men; but everywhere in any institution, in any lodge or church, you will find
                    once in a while a scalawag. Even the garden of paradise has its snakes; likewise
                    did the big <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> at <ref target="#lancaster"
                        >Lancaster</ref>, for some of the old guards were not in sympathy with the
                    warden's methods of treating the inmates like men. There is no doubt in my mind
                    that Major <ref target="#antles">Antles</ref>, the new deputy warden, was a
                    brave and daring soldier, who while I was sitting in my little room discussing
                    our war with <ref target="#spain">Spain</ref>, he was in the jungles of <ref
                        target="#cuba">Cuba</ref>, ready to fight to uphold the honor of the
                    greatest flag in the world. Major <ref target="#antles">Antles</ref> looked upon
                    an inmate as a man who seldom, very seldom reforms, while the warden believed
                    that while not all reform, that the average convict does, and that still more
                    would reform if modern methods were employed and better facilities for
                    individual treatment were at hand.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the deputy warden and his assistant had been in charge of the
                    punishment. From time to time came complaints to the warden of unjust
                    punishments or such as were unnecessary, where a reprimand or a good heart to
                    heart talk would have accomplished more. Finally there appeared in the <q><ref
                            target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> Daily News</q> of August 29; 1912, an
                    article criticising (sic) the deputy warden for <q>stringing up</q> men for not
                    saluting him when he walked through a factory. Again on September 3, 1912,
                    appeared another article of the same kind, stating that inmates <ref
                        target="#ross">Ross</ref> and <ref target="#howard">Howard</ref> had been
                        <q>strung up</q> for failure to stand at attention while the deputy warden
                    walked through Factory <q>C.</q> Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>
                    called on the deputy for an explanation.</p>
                <p>He also gave orders that in the future no officer or guard be permitted to punish
                    an inmate - that all punishment were to come under his own supervision. There
                    being always two sides to a story, the warden not only heard the guard's
                    complaints but the story of the prisoner as well. This was something new to the
                    old guards. Usually a good heart to heart talk between the warden and the sinner
                    set everything right and, he went away with hope in his heart to sin no more.
                    Another rule went into effect at the same time. Any inmate was permitted, on
                    application, to appear before the warden in the evening and state to him any
                    grievance or any ill-treatment that he had received, or to talk over any
                    business matter or talk about his case. The warden took all these matters under
                    careful consideration and gave them his best attention. Everybody was happy and
                    taking it as a whole, the officers and guards were well satisfied and so were
                    the inmates. The relations between them and Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref> had become not like that of a keeper - I mean a watchman,
                    whose prime duty it is to stand on guard to keep them from getting out - but
                    that of a good true friend. At the same time, these inmates were not a special
                    run of men, but just ordinary men, the same as you find in those prisons that
                    within the past months have become notorious for mutiny and revolt. The warden
                    did not happen to be of the ordinary run of wardens. He was a man of sufficient
                    moral weight to hold under easy control those he was sent out to govern, and
                    only in the rarest instances was his confidence abused. In such cases the
                    offender was punished only by taking away his privileges to receive visitors, to
                    receive tobacco and to write letters.</p>
                <p>On September the sixth, the warden took into his personal charge the keys to the
                    hole; and except as to serve as a place for the keeping of condemned men, Hell
                    was Abandoned.</p>
                <p>I have told my reader of several instances where the warden depended upon the
                    word of an outcast, and I could tell you of scores of others who lived up to
                    their word; but there is an exception to most rules and also to this one. There
                    were altogether ten escapes during Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick's</ref>
                    administration, all of whom were yardmen or gardeners; nobody sawed their way
                    out. Of these, ten, five were recaptured the same day, and five were never
                    recovered although we have a line on two of them. <ref target="#melick">Mr.
                        Melick</ref> also recovered one prisoner, who escaped during another
                    administration, and located two more serving time in other penitentiaries. One
                    of those who escaped and was recovered, was a young man, a relative of <ref
                        target="#morley">Morley</ref>, who had just been refused a parole and was
                    also an escape from a <ref target="#kansas">Kansas</ref> prison. It was unknown
                    to the warden that this boy had been placed on the outside of the walls as a
                    trusty, and the assistant deputy warden was blamed for having done it; but while
                    the assistant deputy warden blundered, the deputy, who knew the boy's record, as
                    well as knew that he was wanted in <ref target="#kansas">Kansas</ref>, should
                    have ordered him back within the walls. With no hope whatever, with many years
                    in prison staring him in the face, you could hardly blame the boy for running
                    away. Perhaps you, my reader, would have done likewise; but you can rightfully
                    blame the officers who put him on the outside as well as the superior officer
                    who sanctioned it. If he had escaped, what would the <ref target="#kansas"
                        >Kansas</ref> prison officials have said? Could you blame them for thinking
                    that the escape was a frame-up and that someone was getting <q>a piece of
                        money</q> for it?</p>
                <p>Again, when at his desk one afternoon, Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>
                    saw a lifetime safeblower, one of the most notorious men behind the walls, a
                    desperate man and a <soCalled>dope</soCalled> fiend, working on the outside
                    shoveling coal. He immediately turned him in. I wonder what the Nebraska Bankers
                    Association would have said had this man escaped, for Mr. <ref target="#johnson"
                        >Johnson</ref> had spent much time and money tracing him from place to
                    place. From that day a rule went into effect that no man was to be taken outside
                    of the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> walls, not even for a few minutes,
                    without permission of the warden; consequently there were no more escapes.</p>
                <p>During the first week in May, 1912, came the trial of <ref target="#morley"
                        >Morley</ref>, and he having no funds wherewith to employ an attorney, Judge
                        <ref target="#stewart">Stewart</ref> appointed Mr. <ref target="#frampton"
                        >W. C. Frampton</ref> to defend him. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> was
                    tried on May 4, 1912. At noon on the following Monday the judge notified the
                    court that they had rendered a verdict. The <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>
                    was notified, <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> handcuffed to Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref>, and accompanied by Mr. <ref
                        target="#candless">S. A. McCandless</ref>, arrived at the court house. <ref
                        target="#morley">Morley</ref> walked in briskly, holding himself erect.
                    While waiting for Judge <ref target="#stewart">Stewart</ref> to arrive he was
                    calm but showed some evidence of nervousness by drumming with his fingers on the
                    back of the chair. He talked with several men around the courtroom, and said to
                    one: <said>>Well, I wonder what it will be.</said>
                    <said>Cheer up,</said> said one, <said>I don't think they will order you a black
                        suit.</said>
                    <said>Or a rope,</said> said <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref>, and smiled
                    nervously. When the mother arrived at the court house, she asked permission of
                    the warden to see her son. She spoke a few words of encouragement to him. Tears
                    came into his eyes as she left, and he was silent for a long time.
                    Notwithstanding the fact that he was waiting to learn whether he was to live or
                    die, <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> was able to joke. In reply to a
                    question, he said that he slept well the night before and had enjoyed his meals
                    yesterday. <said>Do they allow you to play cards out there?</said> asked
                    Attorney <ref target="#frampton">Frampton</ref>. <said>No they don't,</said>
                    said <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref>, <said>but anyway, I have enough of
                        solitary, it is getting monotonous.</said> During the time of waiting the
                    talk turned to the escape and chase of the murderers in <ref target="#sarpy"
                        >Sarpy County</ref>. <ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> said that <ref
                        target="#gray">Shorty Gray</ref> had blown the door lock off with cotton
                    soaked in nitro-glycerine. He said that they had a considerable quantity of this
                    cotton and threw it away at the end of the chase. <said>Didn't you see a package
                        tied up in a handkerchief hanging on a bush at the side of the road near
                        where the fight ended? That was the cotton which we put there because we
                        were afraid it might get hit by a bullet and blow us up.</said> Turning to a
                        <soCalled>Star</soCalled> reporter who had been in the chase, he asked:
                        <said>Do you know who got my little '38,' that I carried that day? If we had
                        that I could show that I did not break my gun while we were in the chapel.
                            <ref target="#doody">Doody</ref> and <ref target="#henry">Red
                            Henry</ref> say that I broke the gun and reloaded it. The gun that I had
                        was a Colt, one of those that won't eject the shells.</said> He smiled again
                    when one of the men asked him about the speeches he made from the rear end of
                    the train which brought him and his dead companions back from <ref
                        target="#gretna">Gretna</ref>. <said>You can sure say that you
                    have</said></p>

                <head type="title"> THEIR BEST FRIEND</head>

                <p><ref target="#morley">Morley</ref> was put to work in the chair factory and was a
                    model prisoner. Formerly he had enjoyed all the notoriety that he was getting,
                    but now he seemed to shun it. I remember on several occasions when I took
                    visitors through the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> that he either turned
                    away or held a newspaper up before his face to protect him from the stares of
                    the curious.</p>
                <p>I recall a case of a large negro who had the reputation of being the toughest
                    negro in the pen. On a cold December day this man went on the warpath out in the
                    yard and refused to go to the hole. Three guards were closing in upon him, one
                    armed with a piece of lead pipe. The negro backed -up against the wall and was
                    ready to fight the three of them when Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>
                    came along and ordered the guards to stand back. Putting his hand upon the
                    negro's shoulder he said, <said>My boy, you are not going to get struck by that
                        pipe as long as I am in charge.</said> The guard dropped the pipe and the
                    three slunk away like beaten curs. The warden and the negro had a heart to heart
                    talk; soon the tears came trickling down his face. For four years the poor
                    fellow had been behind the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> walls and had
                    seven more to serve, all the time proclaiming his innocence. In all those long
                    years no one ever spoke a word of sympathy to him until this warden came along.
                    With joy in his heart he went back to work, and worked as he had never worked
                    before. It goes to show that the handling of men is a matter of judgment; and
                    that one man, the right man, with a few words of kindness can accomplish more
                    than a score armed with guns and clubs. While there were just as many guns and
                    clubs in the <ref target="#prison">Nebraska prison</ref> as there were in that
                    eastern <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> where mutiny holds high carnival
                    right now, they were not used, for this warden detested government by force and
                    preferred and promoted government by peace and kindness.</p>
                <p>A democratic governor had been elected. No sooner did this become known at <ref
                        target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref> than the boys circulated a petition
                    among themselves and addressed it to Governor <ref target="#morehead"
                        >Morehead</ref> asking that he not take Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref> away from them. The petition was, however, never mailed, as
                    the warden held it back.</p>
                <p>Now came the end of the biennium and the warden made his report to the governor
                    and the legislature. The deficiency which former Warden <ref target="#smith"
                        >Smith</ref> predicted to be about ten thousand dollars was, however,
                    thirteen thousand dollars; and considering that the state institutions in <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> owed the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>
                    nearly ten thousand dollars for electric light, the actual deficiency was about
                    four thousand dollars. At every place where there was a chance to save a penny -
                    that penny was saved. The coal bill was given close attention and several
                    thousand dollars were saved on that item. In his report the warden said that he
                    had managed the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> by open and aboveboard
                    methods. There is not one receipt nor disbursement but what can be explained.
                    The books are open and the public may come and see for themselves. He closes the
                    report with a few words of cheer for the inmates, bids them dispense with
                    despair, and with hope in their hearts look forward to better days to come.</p>
                <p>Now Christmas is the greatest holiday at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>!
                    Usually the boys commence to make a lot of noise early in the morning but this
                    morning everything was quiet; they were too downhearted to cheer for they had
                    learned that their best friend was to leave them. When Chief Justice <ref
                        target="#reese">Reese</ref> of the supreme court, speaking to the prisoners
                    at the chapel service, made a kind mention of Warden <ref target="#melick"
                        >Melick</ref>, this sentiment was cheered by the prisoners. One a colored
                    man, the same one that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter; violated
                    the rules by exclaiming: <q>He is the best warden that we ever had.</q> It was
                    an unusual scene at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, and those present
                    were much impressed by the sentiment shown by the prisoners.</p>
                <p>No prisoner ever left the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> without going to the
                    warden's office and thanking him for his kind treatment. The scores of letters
                    received from, the boys on the outside go to prove that Warden <ref
                        target="#melick">Melick</ref>, as well as <ref target="#msmeelick">Mrs.
                        Melick</ref>, will never be forgotten by those unfortunates who happened to
                    come to <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>.</p>
                <p>On the last day of Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick's</ref> administration a
                    minstrel show was given in honor of the members of the legislature, at the close
                    of which Doctor <ref target="#harmon">Harmon</ref>, on behalf of the inmates,
                    presented to the warden a silver service enclosed in a massive chest. Upon each
                    piece of the service the warden's initials were engraved. The boys had taken up
                    a collection among themselves. When the list was sent to my office, I noticed
                    that several men had put down all the money that they had on deposit. I took the
                    list and called on these men, who told me that they wanted to give all they had,
                    and would like to give much more had they only possessed it. They said that they
                    wanted to give the warden a present that he would be proud of as long as he
                    lived. After much discussion pro and con, I finally made them understand that it
                    was the spirit of the gift far more than the money value that the warden would
                    appreciate. The contributions were then reduced to only a few cents per inmate.
                    In his presentation speech Doctor <ref target="#harmon">Harmon</ref> said:
                        <said>In the future, that whatever honor fortune or merit showers upon you,
                        you will be remembered by these men as the best warden they ever
                    had.</said></p>

                <head type="title"> A PLEA FOR THE BOYS IN GRAY</head>

                <p>In other chapters I have told my readers how the discharged prisoner is turned
                    out into the world with only five dollars in money, dressed in a six dollar
                    suit, a dollar and a quarter hat and a two dollar pair of shoes. It matters not
                    whether he has served one year or twenty, nor whether his home is in <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref> or in the extreme western part of the state.
                    It is five dollars to one and all; and if that amount is insufficient to take
                    them to their home, they will have to walk, fly, beg or steal. If they choose
                    the latter and are caught; it will cost the state some more money in keeping
                    them and bringing them back to <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref>.</p>
                <p>I have also told you how the paroled men are turned out into the world, with no
                    money whatever. They are not even furnished a suit of clothes, but have to
                    depend upon the prison officials for old clothes or go out into the world in
                    their convict garb.</p>
                <p>I appeal to you, good people of <ref target="#nebraska">Nebraska</ref>, to do all
                    you can to remedy this. A law has been passed to properly equip the outgoing
                    inmates; but the legislature forgot to appropriate funds for this purpose, and
                    the convict gets nothing, not even a credit memorandum for what is due him.
                    There are plenty of other funds; and, especially do I call my reader's attention
                    to the general repair fund of twelve thousand dollars, of which amount over
                    one-half will perhaps not be used, and at the end of the biennium returned to
                    the state. And while this fund was appropriated for general repairs, I believe
                    that the board of commissioners for the state institutions has the authority to
                    change these funds as they see fit. At any rate it would be well to take the
                    matter up and have the attorney general pass on it. If this cannot be done, the
                    matter must be taken up with the legislature. Some one should be on hand in the
                    legislative halls to see that it is attended to. The legislature also passed a
                    law providing for payment of earnings to the prisoners; but again they forgot to
                    appropriate funds for such a purpose; and again the prisoners get nothing, not
                    even a credit memorandum. If this, their just dues, was paid them, they could
                    send this money to their wives and children who now live in poverty and misery.
                    Will not some one start the ball rolling by calling on the governor or on the
                    board, to have this wrong rectified? I wish to appeal to you who employ labor,
                    and call your attention to the paroled men. Of these men, ninety out of each
                    hundred make good; they cannot quit just when they please, but are under the
                    supervision of the warden and the board. You assume no financial responsibility
                    when you employ such a man, and you perform indeed a Christian and charitable
                    act.</p>
                <p>Several associations work to better the outgoing men. The <ref

                    remuneration to aid their fallen brothers. If you, my reader, wish to contribute
                    a little for the benefit of the outgoing prisoner, then contribute to either one
                    of these two associations, and shun all others. Give no aid to the others,
                    although they sail under the title of <soCalled>Reverend</soCalled> or

                    stamped upon their faces. Some of these latter come along and talk

                        condition,</said> was my answer. <said>Who is Governor <ref
                            target="#morehead">Morehead</ref> going to put in as

                    they asked me. I told them that I did not know, but hoped that the present
                    incumbent would be reappointed. <said>Well, he never will, for <ref
                            target="#morehead">Morehead</ref> has already appointed Mr.

                        get?</said> I asked. <said>Well, I do not know for certain, but they will
                        get something.</said>
                    <said>Do you mean to say that Governor <ref target="#morehead">Morehead</ref>
                        will feed these snakes?</said> asked one of the gentlemen in the lobby.
                        <said>You just wait and see for yourselves,</said> said the gentleman from
                    the state house. <said>Well, if he does, he will get but few votes in <ref
                            target="#clay">Clay county</ref> if he ever runs again</said> said
                    several of the men. However, the <ref target="#morehead">governor</ref>
                    appointed only two of them, one at the <ref target="#prison">penitentiary</ref>
                    and one at another state institution; and, had he known the facts as they were,
                    he would never have appointed them. One of them came to the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> to enter upon his duties. He came into my
                    office, held out his hand, and professed to be delighted to see me. I turned and
                    walked away from him, for rather would I take the slimy form of a rattlesnake
                    into my hand than to touch the hand of this man. And the other party? He is not
                    much better. For some years he drew a salary from the state, but was too busy
                    masticating tobacco to do any real work. I have heard him insult men because
                    they were republicans, and I have heard him apply his pet nick-name, that of
                        <soCalled>tape worm</soCalled> to those that he disliked - a filthy old man,
                    a disgrace to our state. As I have stated, my own sins are many. I have been
                    wild and shiftless in my younger days; but I challenge those two gentlemen or
                    anyone to prove that I have ever lowered the dignity of my office by either
                    grafting from the inmates, directly or indirectly, (and I have had many chances
                    to do so) nor have I lived in open adultery with a woman while having a wife and
                    children of my own, for I never succeeded in getting a wife - not to speak of
                    two, and I have never made <soCalled>dates</soCalled> with the wives, sisters
                    and daughters of the prisoners, on the pretence that I possessed sufficient
                    influence to get their relatives out of prison; nor have I been a
                        <soCalled>chippy chaser</soCalled> on the dark streets of <ref
                        target="#lincoln">Lincoln</ref>, for most of my evenings were spent at the
                    desk, adjusting matters on the books that were left open by my predecessor, who,
                    however did not forget to draw his salary check. And snake number three, what
                    became of him? Why, he appealed to Warden <ref target="#fenton">Fenton</ref> for
                    the position as steward at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>. When the
                    warden told him that a steward had been appointed, this man was willing to
                    accept the office of chief clerk. When he learned that this position was also
                    filled, he, patient as he was, offered his services as a guard, but this, too,
                    was refused.</p>
                <p>These three men are all over sixty years old. It was their favorite pastime to
                    gather in an office and talk ill about Warden <ref target="#delahunty"
                        >Delahunty</ref> and the great church to which he belonged. Soon each of
                    these men will be in a little pine box covered with earth, and then they will
                    stand before that great tribunal above and receive the sentence due them for
                    their misdeeds.</p>

                <p>The new democratic warden is <ref target="#fenton">William T. Fenton</ref>,
                    formerly sheriff of <ref target="#richardson">Richardson county</ref>. He
                    engaged my services for six months, gave me a square deal, and religiously kept
                    every promise he made me. For many years he has served as sheriff of <ref
                        target="#richardson">Richardson county</ref>, and has proven himself to be a
                    brave and efficient officer. <ref target="#richardson">Richardson county</ref>,
                    on account of its location bordering on this and two other states, had for years
                    been a rendezvous for criminals, especially horse thieves, but Sheriff <ref
                        target="#fenton">Fenton</ref> drove these gentlemen out to seek shelter in
                    other places; and while performing this duty he often took chances of being
                    killed. On the night of the outbreak at the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>,
                    he received a message that the three desperadoes were on a freight train headed
                        for<ref target="#fallsCity"> Falls City</ref>. The sheriff accompanied by
                    Deputy Sheriff <ref target="#mcfarland">McFarland</ref>, and Chief of Police
                        <ref target="#copaldrich">Aldrich</ref>, were already on guard in the
                    railroad yards when the message came, and soon the train arrived. Sheriff <ref
                        target="#fenton">Fenton</ref> searched the train and came upon an empty car
                    in which were three men. He ordered them to come out, but they refused. Then at
                    the risk of his life, he jumped into the car; with a pistol in his hand. He
                    ordered the three men to holdup, their hands and get out, of the car, Which they
                    did. While two of them answered the description of <ref target="#gray">Shorty
                        Gray</ref> and <ref target="#dowd">Dowd</ref>, they, however were not the
                    dynamiters. Together with Sheriffs <ref target="#fisher">Fisher</ref> of <ref

                    organized a posse to follow up the desperadoes, and they left for <ref
                        target="#sarpy">Sarpy county</ref> on a special train.</p>
                <p>I was glad indeed that the office came to Mr. <ref target="#fenton">Fenton</ref>,
                    for I have known him for several years and found him to be a kind man and a
                    gentleman. I knew that he would give the boys a square deal and keep up the good
                    work commenced by Warden <ref target="#melick">Melick</ref>. He started in
                    fighting the <soCalled>dope</soCalled> traffic. In this he was aided by the new
                    law passed, making the bringing of <soCalled>dope</soCalled> into the <ref
                        target="#prison">prison</ref> a felony, and now the use of dope is reduced
                    to the minimum.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the warden had been in supreme command, but on July 1, 1913 came the
                    board of commissioners for state institutions. They are to the warden what the
                    duma is to the once mighty czar of <ref target="#russia">Russia</ref>. The
                    warden's hands, as well as those at the head of the other state institutions,
                    are tied by this board. A mighty good thing for the taxpayers of the state is
                    this board, that is, when it comes to spending the coin. Domiciled in luxurious
                    quarters in our ready-to-fall statehouse, are the offices of these three
                    distinguished gentlemen, who are to save their own and their employees'
                    salaries, and office supplies amounting to about fourteen thousand dollars per
                    annum, by careful buying of supplies for the state institutions, as well as
                    preventing graft at the different institutions. In the future all grafting will
                    be done by this august body, and thus save the briber's railroad fare to the
                    various institutions. However, this applies to the future and not to the
                    present, as the three commissioners now in office are men of the highest
                    character and integrity and are, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. Two of
                    them are lawyers, one is a farmer, though the public somewhat expected to see a
                    practical business man on the board. The purchases for all state institutions
                    are made once every three months and samples are submitted. The merchants who
                    bid on supplies are permitted to come to the office and take their place in the
                        <q>dead line</q>, which means that <q>mum is the word.</q> Now commences one
                    of <ref target="#holcomb">Governor Holcomb's</ref> famous tea parties. Eight or
                    ten merchants submit samples, each of nine or ten different kinds of teas. Tea
                    pots and hot water are brought in and the brewing of tea commences. Tasting a
                    cup of tea, <ref target="#holcomb">Governor Holcomb</ref> says to a merchant,
                        <said>This is mighty nice tea. What is the price of it?</said>
                    <said>Seventy cents, <ref target="#holcomb">governor</ref>, this is Tipton's
                        number one.</said>
                    <said>Heavens, no,</said> says Mr. <ref target="#gerdes">Gerdes</ref>.
                        <said>Down where I lived we used to get some from Montgomery Ward for nine
                        cents. It was good stuff, too, and red as oxblood. Haven't you got some of
                        that?</said>
                    <said>Here is something that tastes good to me,</said> says Judge <ref
                        target="#kennedy">Kennedy</ref> to another merchant. <said>How much is
                        this?</said>
                    <said>Well gentlemen,</said> says the merchant, <said>on account of my good
                        furtune; which I stand ready to share with you, I offer this tea for twelve
                        and nine-tenths cents. Before the outbreak of the revolution in <ref
                            target="#china">China</ref> and the capture of Ching-Chung Chow, I had
                        bought large quantities. of this tea and stored it in <ref
                            target="#hongKong">Hong Kong</ref>. This same tea now sells for eighteen
                        cents by other firms, and is going still higher.</said></p>
                <p>And now comes Mr. <ref target="#gerdes">Gerdes'</ref> coffee party. <said>What is
                        this kind worth?</said> says Mr. <ref target="#gerdes">Gerdes</ref>,
                    sampling a cup of coffee. <said>We would let that go for forty cents per
                        pound,</said> says the merchant. That is decided to be too dear; and after
                    sampling about eighty other kinds, Mr. <ref target="#gerdes">Gerdes</ref>, in
                    despair, asks if there are no samples of Carbuckles coffee at all. There is not;
                    but finally a brand worth seventeen cents is selected and the coffee party is at
                    an end. On the purchases of tea and coffee, the board has saved the state nearly
                    ten dollars, which helps to make up the salary and expenses of the board of
                    about forty dollars for the two days. And not only does the board save money by
                    making purchases, but also by reducing and refusing unnecessary and extravagant
                    requests for supplies. For instance, fruit cannot be bought on contract, and all
                    requests for such must go to the board. Here comes a request from Superintendent
                    So-and-so for bananas, for this superintendent likes bananas for breakfast.
                        <said>Didn't we let him have some bananas the other day?</said> says one
                    member. <said>Yes we did,</said> says another. The request for such a luxury is
                    refused, but the superintendent, however, may buy some at his own expense.
                    Another dime is saved.</p>
                <p>And recently the board has shown its usefulness in still another matter. It has
                    sent out notice to all superintendents to get rid right speedily of all
                    relatives who are on the pay roll - save one, as permitted by law. Gus.
                    Buchholz, farm superintendent at the <ref target="#prison">penitentiary</ref>,
                    came first, he being the brother-in-law of <ref target="#prison">Henry
                        Gerdes</ref>, a member of the board. I feel sorry for the state in this
                    instance, for Mr. <ref target="#buchholz">Buchholz</ref> is the best farm
                    superintendent the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref> ever had, and was just the
                    right man for the position a well as a good, true man and a gentleman. The
                    warden will have to hunt a long time to find a man a competent as Mr. <ref
                        target="#buchholz">Buchholz</ref>. Several other wives, daughters, aunts and
                    cousins had to walk the plank. At the Soldier's Home at Milford, Colonel David
                    Rowdin, the commandant, cleaved onto his son, who is the adjutant of the home,
                    and presented his wife, daughter and son-in-law with their time checks. The
                    board goes on to announce that it will not permit the shifting of relatives of
                    one superintendent to the jurisdiction of another. At Hastings, Superintendent
                    Baxter of the <ref target="#insaneasylum">insane asylum</ref> has a choice
                    between his wife, who is the matron, and the daughter. The daughter walks the
                    plank. At the <ref target="#prison">prison</ref>, Warden <ref target="#fenton"
                        >Fenton</ref> accepts the resignation of a cousin, <ref target="#wjFenton"
                        >W. J. Fenton</ref>, who is a guard and a competent one at that. A flock of
                    relatives at the other institutions are preparing to go, and it looks as if
                    every superintendent must get their books of genealogy and trace back at least
                    seven generations. In this respect Mr. N. C. Abbott, superintendent of the state
                    school for the blind, at Beatrice, has them all beaten. He has before him his
                    book of genealogy and can trace back for seven generations. When his second
                    laundress quits, and a woman by the name of Abbott is appointed to take her
                    place, the superintendent after a careful search, sits down and writes to the
                    board that it is with regret that he reports the loss by resignation of one of
                    his most valued employes (sic), and that he has Mabel Abbott to take her place.
                    In order to prevent the newspaper boys from throwing any fits on the, score of
                    nepotism, he adds that she is of German origin, while his branch of the Abbotts
                    has picked up no foreign blood save that of Spanish, Irish, Jew and Swedish.</p>
                <p>And not even the method of that sterling democrat, Mr. <ref target="#smith">T. W.
                        Smith</ref>, the former warden, seems to fit for this occasion, for when
                    Uncle Sam discontinued the <ref target="#lancaster">Lancaster</ref> post office,
                    his daughter, the postmistress, automatically became short of a position that
                    had paid her about thirty dollars per month. Mr. <ref target="#smith"
                        >Smith</ref> appointed her a mail clerk at a salary of thirty-five dollars.
                    It appears to me that the only thing for the army of dear ones to do is to go
                    hunting for other places. In this undertaking I extend to them my heartfelt,
                    sympathy, and hope that they all succeed.</p>

                <head type="title">CONCLUSION</head>

                <p>In conclusion I wish to thank all those good people who have worked so hard and
                    faithfully and done so much for the boys in gray. May the good Lord bless them
                    and theirs. From the bottom of my heart I thank those who have extended to me
                    the hand of friendship and good fellowship; I shall do my best to show that I am
                    worthy of such friendship. Towards the state of Nebraska, my conscience is
                    clear, as well as towards those unfortunate boys at Lancaster. I challenge
                    anyone to show where I have converted to my personal use one penny belonging
                    either to them or to the state, or to show where I have committed one single act
                    unbecoming a gentleman while in the service of the state. I pride myself on
                    having brought order out of the chaos that the former incumbent of the office so
                    kindly left for me. I feel pleased and happy that the governor and the warden
                    were satisfied with my work. Those who read this book, I thank them for their
                    patience. To those busybodies who for a long time have been so busy criticising
                    (sic) me, I have said much in foregoing chapters. To them I shall say no more
                    except, to quote to them a poem by Richard Mansfield:</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>"If once at bay I touched a crime</l>
                    <l>In boyhood's hot-head heedless time</l>
                    <l>And all my neighbors rang the chime</l>
                    <l>Wherever I might wander,</l>
                    <l>Do you believe I could outlive,</l>
                    <l>Or that my neighbors would forgive</l>
                    <l>That stretching chain of slander?</l>
                    <l>Do you believe that I could rise</l>
                    <l>And by my doughty deeds and wise</l>
                    <l>Wash out that blot, I wonder?</l>
                    <l>Or if I strived in doing good,</l>
                    <l>And saving all the souls I could</l>
                    <l>Wherever I might wander,</l>
                    <l>Would that one stain upon my name</l>
                    <l>Outweigh my labor and my fame?</l>
                    <l>Alas! You know it would.</l>
                    <l>Would all my struggles, all my tears,</l>
                    <l>For days and nights, for months, for years,</l>
                    <l>Be ever understood?</l>
                    <l>My sorrow and my piteous prayer</l>
                    <l>Might reach Almighty's gracious ear</l>
                    <l>But would my neighbor hear?"</l>
                    <l>"Oh, gentle kind!</l>
                    <l>Oh, kind mankind!</l>
                    <l>Oh, thieves and liars deaf and blind,</l>
                    <l>But never, never dumb.</l>
                    <l>Oh, beasts that drabble in your pen,</l>
                    <l>And beasts that wear the garb of men,</l>
                    <l>What honor to be one!</l>
                    <l>Could I have hid that early crime</l>
                    <l>And tuned. my sycophantine chime</l>
                    <l>To key with pleasing lies</l>
                    <l>And stuff beast's loathsome belly full</l>
                    <l>And pat his elephantine hull,</l>
                    <l>Or please his amorous eyes,</l>
                    <l>How good were I! How wise were I!</l>
                    <l>How well I'd live! How damned I'd die!"</l>
                </lg>

                <p>My soul is filled with peace and my heart is full of joy. It matters not to me
                    that my neighbors will not hear my piteous prayers, for well do I know that they
                    will reach the gracious ear of Him, Who said to the robber upon the cross:
                    "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise. </p>

                <l>THE END</l>

                <note>Deputy Warden at <ref target="#nebraskapenitentiary"/>Nebraska State
                    Penitentiary; Edward D. Davis was born in the northern part of Wales, November
                    16, 1846, and came with his parents to Johnstown, Pennsylvania at an early age.
                    Here he grew to manhood, receiving a common school education. In 1863 he
                    enlisted in the hundred-day service, and in 1864 re-enlisted in the Eighty-third
                    Pennsylvania volunteer infantry, and served to the close of the war. He was
                    married May 10, 1871 to Miss Elizabeth Rees, also a native of Wales. His father
                    died in 1883, and his mother in 1889, a victim of the Johnstown flood. In 1878
                    Mr. and Mrs. <ref target="#davis">Davis</ref> came to Clay County, locating at
                    Glenville, where he followed blacksmithing until elected sheriff in 1887. He
                    held the office of sheriff for four terms and was a popular and efficient
                    officer. He was a man of splendid physical power and courage. He was accustomed
                    to deal with criminals and was fearless in the discharge of his duties. After
                    retiring from the sheriff's office he and Mrs. Davis traveled a great deal. He
                    practically retired from active life except one term as warden of the
                    penitentiary. He retained business interests in Clay Center, being stockholder
                    in the Commercial State Bank of which he was at one time the vice-president. He
                    was a member of the Masons, Odd Fellows and A. O. U. W. At Lancaster, <ref

                    again became the object of admiration from his fellow inmates, this time female.

                <note> This is a reference for the unamed Poet quoted in chapter 11. The author
                    wrote a poem called <title>Be Careful What You Say</title>. This is the name of
                    the poem which a portion of which is quoted in that paragraph. This poem has
                    appeared in a variety of newspapers as early as <date when="1899">1899</date>
                    and as recently as <date when="2005"> 2005</date>. Nobody has been able to trace
                    the name of the author. None of the early versions of this poem are listed as
                    having an author but you can find the poem now attributed to a Joseph Kronthal.
                    I can't find where or why this happened. </note>

                <note> As Nebraska grew, a need for a hospital arose. In <date when="1887"
                        >1887</date>, they established the hospital in Hastings and transferred
                    patients from other hospitals in Lincoln and Norfolk. The hospital grew and
                    became largely self-sustainable through requiring labor from the patients in an
                    effort to make the hospital able to feed itself. There was a large farm and
                    dairy to support this. It was mostly a place for patients to reside with
                    supervision until the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1925"> early 1920s</date>
                    when the first efforts to treat the mentally ill began. These efforts were of
                    the nature of most early pyschiatric efforts such as electroshock therapy. After
                    most of the mental hospital efforts were discontinued in the <date
                        notBefore="1986" notAfter="1989">late 80s</date> part of the facilty was
                    converted into a minimum security prison.This was discontinued in <date
                        when="2002">2002,</date> due to budget cuts. It's been approved for a new
                    facility and new living units, and demolition of some of the old buildings has
                    begun. A new Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center for females is scheduled
                    to open this year <date notBefore="2020" notAfter="2021">(2020 or 2021).</date>
